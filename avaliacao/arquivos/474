AB An infant explored for obstructive jaundice died 6 days
   postoperatively and was found to have extensive infarction of the
   common duct. This would have gone undetected had the patient survived
   and without careful sampling at autopsy. The incidence of this
   unsuspected complication is unknown. Surgical infarction may be one
   cause of fibrosis and secondary atresia of the extra-hepatic bile
   ducts.

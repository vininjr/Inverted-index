AB Alterations in the pulmonary vascular bed were reviewed in the
   autopsy material from 35 patients with cystic fibrosis of the
   pancreas and cor pulmonale.  Hypertrophy of the media or intimal
   proliferation of small muscular arteries and arterioles was noted in
   eight patients; intimal proliferation of the larger caliber arteries
   was seen in seven patients.  The unexpected change, however, was the
   presence of interstitial hyaline material in the media of the
   pulmonary artery or its major branches in one-third of the
   specimens.  The elastic fibers were distorted, but not disrupted,
   and the finding was unrelated to the presence or severity of other
   vascular changes.  Intimal deposits of the same material were also
   present in seven of the patients with intimal proliferation in major
   pulmonary arteries.  Identical medial lesions were found in the
   pulmonary arteries of seven of 35 children with pulmonary
   hypertension and in seven patients with other disorders.  Similar
   lesions in the media of the aorta were found in each group of
   patients.  The material was not Schiff-reactive, but had the
   histochemical characteristics of a connective tissue acid
   mucopolysaccharide.

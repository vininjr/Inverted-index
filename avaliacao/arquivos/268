EX The purpose here was to test for a generalized abnormal sensitivity
   of the external chemoreceptive systems using a standardized method
   that separates sensory activity from biasing factors known to affect
   measurement of sensitivity.  The frequency distributions of salt
   taste sensitivity for patients with cystic fibrosis are given.
   Normal siblings and control patients did not differ statistically,
   and they were combined into a single control group for analyses.  The
   patients with cystic fibrosis did not differ as a group from the
   normal subjects in salt sensitivity.  There were, however, two
   children with cystic fibrosis with taste sensitivities well below
   those observed among the normal children.  No age or sex differences
   in sensitivity were observed.  The taste sensitivity of the children
   with cystic fibrosis did not correlate with the Shwachman and
   Kulczycki rating of the severity of their disease.  Of the seven
   children who had determinations of sweat electrolytes at the time of
   taste testing, three failed to excrete sufficient amounts for
   measurements.  Patients with cystic fibrosis, as a group, were not
   found to have more sensitive taste acuity than normal.  This
   corroborates the findings of Wotman and associates and strongly
   suggests that a general abnormality of the taste system is not
   routinely symptomatic of cystic fibrosis.  Henkin and Powell
   hypothesized that extremely acute taste is related to elevations in
   the concentration of electrolytes in sweat.  This seems unlikely
   since the patients given sweat tests in the present study all had the
   high levels of sodium and chloride characteristic of cystic fibrosis,
   yet all had taste sensitivities in the normal range.  Wotman and
   associates suggested that perhaps the severity of the disease
   accounts for the appearance of hypersensitivity in the chemoreceptive
   systems.  The clinical ratings of the severity of the disease did not
   correlate with taste sensitivity.

EX The otherwise excellent article on bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis
   by Dr Margaret Hodson is seriously marred by the failure to emphasise
   that the advice on management and drug dosage is directed throughout
   to the adult and adolescent, and not to the child.  Firstly,
   tetracycline should not be prescribed for young children for obvious
   reasons; secondly, the dosage of all antibiotics recommended is high
   for infants and small children.  The final paragraph gives a
   pessimistic impression of an undoubtedly distressing condition by
   stressing the early mortality of the past and of many of the older
   patients of today, without noting the effect that early diagnosis -
   perhaps as a result of neonatal screening - together with more
   effective treatment may have in the future on the quality of life and
   length of life.

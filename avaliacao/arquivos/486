AB Finger-clubbing has been measured from the magnified silhouette of
   the right index finger (shadowgram) in 125 subjects, comprising
   children and young adults. The profile and hyponychial angles were
   both found to be good discriminators of clubbing and to be
   independent of age and sex. The normal profile angle was 168.3
   degrees +/- 3.6 and the mean normal hyponychial angle was 180.1
   degrees +/- 4.2. Patients with cystic fibrosis and cyanotic
   congenital heart-disease were found to have grossly elevated values
   of these angles. Some asthmatics were found to have a moderate degree
   of clubbing with significantly elevated values of these angles. The
   shadowgram proved a convenient objective method for recording the
   degree and progress of fingerclubbing in clinical practice.

EX Dr Freed and Dr Buckley have shown that a lectin, concanavalin A (Con
   A), causes severe rhinitis, sinusitis, and increased mucus secretion
   when inhaled by man or small-intestinal colic, foul-smelling flatus,
   and mucus-coated stools if ingested.  It is somewhat surprising that
   the authors suggest that a suitable inhaled or ingested lectin may be
   useful in treating patients with cystic fibrosis, since the very
   symptoms produced by the ingested lectin resemble those associated
   with the disease.  A more attractive recommendation would be for
   patients with cystic fibrosis to avoid substances containing lectins
   such as Con A to avoid stimulating additional mucus release.  The
   underlying pathogenetic defect in cystic fibrosis may be
   inappropriate, excessive stimuli by lectin-like substances.  These
   observations suggest that the increase in the protein content of
   lymphocytes is stimulated by a plasma factor present in patients with
   cystic fibrosis and in carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene.  These
   observations, plus those of Freed and Buckley, might suggest that
   cystic fibrosis is a disease involving a plasma factor with lectin or
   Con A-like activity which stimulates the secretion of mucus and
   increases the enzyme content of circulating or cultured lymphocytes.
   - Professor Lieberman confuses cause with effect.  If there is
   excessive mucus production in cystic fibrosis we suggest that this is
   because the secretion is so difficult to remove from the mucosal
   surface.  Goblet cells and mucus glands become clogged with
   hyperviscid mucus which, not being removed, stimulates further mucus
   production.  To deprive the patient of the mucotractive value of his
   dietary lectins would be a therapeutic mischief equivalent to
   prescribing a cough-suppresant for a productive cough.

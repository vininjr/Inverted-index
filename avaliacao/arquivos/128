EX Nearly all agree that home therapy, which permits cystic fibrosis
   children to lead nearly normal lives, is desirable.  Between hospital
   visits, it's also essential for warding off the primary threats of
   CF: pulmonary insufficiency and cor pulmonale.  Treatment is
   palliative, focusing on supplying enzymes that the body can't secrete
   and, when the lungs are involved, clearing airway obstructions.  The
   first step in therapy is starting the child on supplemental enzymes,
   which will enable him to absorb fat and protein.  Usually we
   encourage a normal diet.  If X-rays, pulmonary function tests, or
   clinical observation shows lung involvement, we initiate pulmonary
   therapy and teach parents how to perform it at home.  Postural
   drainage is continued indefinitely, even if the lungs clear.  If the
   child shows clinical signs of infection, we instruct the parents to
   increase the number of active mist and postural drainage treatments
   and to administer oral antibiotics in high doses.  Above all, we
   instruct the parents of CF children to treat them as normally as
   possible.

EX Inhalation therapy can be divided into two types, intermittent
   aerosol therapy which is used to administer medications over brief
   periods and mist tent therapy which is used for prolonged periods of
   treatment.  The present state of knowledge of the basic defect of
   cystic fibrosis makes it impossible to give hard and fast guide lines
   for the use of inhalation therapy.  Much depends on the individual
   experience of the physician and the degree of pulmonary involvement
   of the individual patient.  Response to bronchodilators can be
   assessed relatively easily, assessment of mucolytics and antibiotics
   is difficult.  Antibiotics can be useful in helping to clear
   infection in those patients with early disease, as judged by clearing
   of pathogens from the cough swab or sputum.  In patients with chronic
   cough and large volumes if purulent sputum with positive culture from
   gram negative bacteria, the cultures never become negative and only
   in the occasional patient can definite clinical benefit be claimed.
   A few severely ill patients have dramatically improved when this
   therapy has been introduced, and the patients are convinced of the
   benefit of this treatment.  It is of course impossible in this
   disease, with such a varying clinical course, to prove scientifically
   that the inhalation therapy was the reason for this improvement.

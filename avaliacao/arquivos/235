AB Detection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) heterozygote by testing for
   cystic fibrosis factor activity (CFFA) in serum samples using
   bioassays had been reported to give unreliable results. The present
   study was undertaken to find whether the use of medium from short
   term white blood cell or skin fibroblast cultures, rather than serum,
   as the test sample would eliminate such inconsistencies. Short term
   white blood cell cultures were established from 107 normal, healthy
   individuals. Cultures from 97 had no CFFA, six (No. 1-6) showed
   variable results and four (No. 7-10) had activity in all four tests
   done on a single sample. When the assays were repeated 3 months later
   on new cultures from these four positive CFFA individuals, two showed
   activity (Nos. 7 & 9) and two did not (Nos. 8 & 10). All 10
   individuals whose cultures showed CFFA has histories of allergies.
   The association of CFFA in the culture medium derived from
   individuals having allergies with the intermittent presence of this
   activity suggested that environmental factors induced a CFF-like
   activity in such white blood cell cultures. The oyster ciliary assay,
   using medium from white blood cell cultures, cannot be used for
   screening for the CF heterozygote since the substitution of culture
   medium for serum did not eliminate inconsistent results and CFFA was
   not specific by this assay for the CF gene. Of the fibroblast lines
   established from the four persons whose initial white blood cell
   cultures consistently showed CFFA, only one (No. 7) showed the CF
   culture phenotype (CFFA positive and metachromasia).

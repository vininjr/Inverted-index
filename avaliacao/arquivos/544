EX Stimulated by Professor R. B. Elliott of Auckland,Australia, we have
   administered Intralipid regularly to a small number of babies in the
   last two years.  The volume used has been 10 ml of the 10% solution
   per kilogram of body weight.  This volume is administered every three
   weeks, the infusion taking approximately three hours.  The four
   entrants in the trial are all doing well clinically.

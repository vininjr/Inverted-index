AB Injections of serum from human patients with cystic fibrosis into
   adult rats caused pronounced structural modifications and increased
   mitotic rate in the parotid gland. Mitotic rate was increased from a
   low level of 0.02/1,000 acinar cells in parotid glands of adult rats
   to 6.5/1,000 acinar cells after 2 or 3 days of serum injection. At
   the light and electron microscopic levels, significant acinar cell
   atrophy and degranulation were observed. Cellular necrosis, and
   increases in quantity of lysosome-like dense bodies, mast cells, and
   macrophages were also detected. These changes are suggestive of
   tissue response to injurious foreign protein. Furthermore, the fact
   that normal sera pronounced the same kind of effects (but greatly
   reduced in extent) strengthens the view that these effects result
   from the immunologic response of the host organ to foreign antigen.
   Since, however, the responses of the rat parotid to cystic fibrosis
   serum were considerably more marked than those elicited by normal
   serum, the rat parotid may thus have potential usefulness in assaying
   for the presence of human cystic fibrosis factor.

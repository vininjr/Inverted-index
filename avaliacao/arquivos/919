EX Like Dr Chase and Dr Dupont we have found essential fatty-acid
   deficiency, usually subclinical, in cystic fibrosis patients.
   However, we feel that their data on prostaglandin synthesis may have
   other interpretations.  In patients with deficiency of linoleic
   acid, oleic acid is used an alternative substrate; and instead of
   dihomogammalinoleic acid, an alternative 20:3 fatty acid is produced.
   We have found increased amounts of this substance in the plasma of
   patients with cystic fibrosis.  We agree with the authors' conclusion
   that levels of linoleic acid are specifically related to P.G.
   production in children with cystic fibrosis.  It remains to be shown
   whether children with cystic fibrosis have a primary abnormality of
   fatty-acid metabolism or whether the observed disturbances of
   prostaglandin metabolism are secondary to malabsorption of dietary
   essential fatty acids.  In either case, certain clinical features of
   the disease may well be explained by prostaglandin disturbances.

   RESPIRATORY-FUNCTION-TESTS.
AB Tests claimed to detect small airway disease were evaluated in
   children.  Fifty-two subjects who were normal, 30 with cystic
   fibrosis (CF), and 35 with asthma were selected on the basis of
   normal spirometry, informed consent being obtained from them and
   their parents.  Tests undertaken were measurement of maximum
   expiratory flow volume curves breathing air and a helium-oxygen
   mixture, single breath nitrogen washout curves, lung volumes, and,
   except in the normal subjects, measurement of arterial oxygen
   tension.  Closing volumes were normal in most children with CF and
   asthma, whereas the slope of the alveolar plateau was abnormal in
   83%.  Maximum expiratory flow rate at 50% of total lung capacity was
   reduced in 65% and maximum mid-expiratory flow rate in 57%; residual
   volume increased in 51%, and results of other tests were abnormal in
   less than 50% of the children.  There was evidence suggesting that
   lung disease was more patchy in children with mild CF than in those
   with interval phase asthma.  These tests do not detect specific
   pathological processes in small airways but reflect the consequences
   of small airway abnormalities, which may vary in the same disease as
   well as in different diseases.  No one test alone appears most
   useful.  Together they contribute to understanding the functional
   abnormalities present in each individual.

EX Several reports have indicated the presence of abnormally high
   amounts of sulphate in the mucous glands of patients with cystic
   fibrosis.  Bearing these facts in mind, we suspected that abnormal,
   over-sulphated, and strongly anionic, glycoproteins might be involved
   in the pathogenesis of CF.  The present study was carried out to
   determine whether sulphated blood-group substances occur in normal
   pancreatic tissue.  The distribution of sulphate over the exocrine
   part of pancreas does coincide with the distribution of blood-group
   substance previously observed by fluorescent microscopy.  We
   therefore find it very likely that the sulphate and blood-group
   substance are associated with the same glycoprotein molecule.  Since
   blood-group substance has been demonstrated in many secretions in
   man, and since high amounts of sulphate have been found in the
   mucous glands in CF, such a mechanism is possible in many locations
   and may thus offer an explanation for the multiorgan involvement in
   CF.

AB Thirty-one patients with cystic fibrosis of varying severity were
   examined by echocardiography. Right ventricular dimension (RVD) was
   above upper normal limit in 14 patients and right ventricular
   dimension index (RVD index) was higher than the upper normal limit in
   11 patients. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship
   between increasing RVD index and 1) decreasing forced vital capacity
   (FVC) both actual test results and average 6 months values; and 2)
   decreasing peak-expiratory flow rate (PEFR) both actual test results
   and average 6 months values. This observation suggests a persistent
   heart involvement. Five patients had either heart failure and/or
   electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular abnormality. These
   patients had increased RVD index and one patient with the highest RVD
   index died 8 weeks after the examination. The present study has shown
   the usefulness of echocardiographic measurement of right ventricular
   dimension and of septal motion in assessing cor pulmonale, before
   development of electrocardiographic abnormalities and right heart
   failure.

EX Burns and May proposed the following pattern for the bacteriology of
   cystic fibrosis: (1) Staphylococcus aureus is the initial bacterial
   pathogen, and damage caused by it renders the lungs susceptible to
   infection by other species.  (2) Control of S. aureus by antibiotics
   allows the influx of Haemophilus influenzae.  (3) Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa is introduced and continued chemotherapy encourages its
   establishment.  (4) P. aeruginosa supplants S. aureus and H.
   influenzae, becoming the sole pathogen.  I have examined these ideas
   by quantitative culture of sputum from 20 patients seen at the Cystic
   Fibrosis Treatment and Research Center, University of Oregon Health
   Sciences Center from 1965 to 1977.  The results accord with the
   original hypothesis of Burns and May.  In 13 of 20 patients the
   sputum bacterial flora changed as the hypothesis of Burns and May
   predicted.  This preliminary data suggests that one of the primary
   sputum abnormalities in cystic fibrosis may be increased Ca++ which
   makes the sputum susceptible to colonisation by S. aureus.  After
   infection the Ca++ concentration is reduced and the lung becomes
   susceptible to colonisation by other microorganisms including H.
   influenzae, P. aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.

EX We have developed a new technique for detecting cystic fibrosis
   (C.F.) and the heterozygote of C.F.  The assay can be done by any
   laboratory having an aggregometer for measuring platelet aggregation.
   Quantitation of the results is obtained by comparing the
   transmittance recorded when only A.D.P. is added to platelet-rich
   plasma (P.R.P.). In C.F. patients and known heterozygotes, this ratio
   is 4 - 9 times higher than in healthy subjects.  We have tested
   P.R.P. from 40 healthy people, 25 patients with C.F., and 40 known
   heterozygotes.  We could detect all C.F. patients and 95% of the
   known heterozygotes.

AB Phospholipase A2, lysolecithinase, and lysolecithin-lysolecithin
   acyltransferase are present in the airway secretions of patients
   with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and alveolar proteinosis.  Assays
   of these enzymes under the same conditions in extracts of human
   polymorphonuclear leukocytes, alveolar macrophages, and pig tracheal
   mucosa indicated that these extracellular airway enzymes were
   probably not derived from these cell types.  Although the above
   three enzymes were present in secretions of all patients with these
   three diseases, large amounts of palmitoyl lysolecithin, free fatty
   acids, and dipalmitoyl lecithin were found only in patients having
   alveolar proteinosis and asthma.  The amount of free fatty acids in
   these secretions was sufficient to inhibit both the lysolecithinase
   and the lysolecithin-lysolecithin acyltransferase, but not the
   phospholipase A2.  These findings suggest that the large amount of
   dipalmitoyl lecithin, free fatty acids, and lysolecithin found in
   these secretions results from extracellular remodelling by these
   enzymes.  Because the phospholipase A2 was present in large amounts,
   it was possible after delipidation to purify it to homogeneity.  It
   is a stable enzyme with an apparent molecular weight of 75,000 as
   estimated by SDS-mercaptoethanol gel electrophoresis.

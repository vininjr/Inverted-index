AB The carotid bodies from 71 patients ranging in age from 28 weeks'
   gestation to 30 years were obtained at autopsy. Patients were divided
   into two groups based on the presence or absence of chronic
   hypoxemia. There was a high correlation between the weight of
   individual carotid bodies in each case. Among the 12 patients with
   chronic hypoxemia, eight patients had carotid bodies heavier than
   predicted by statistical analysis. Of these eight patients, six had
   cystic fibrosis and two had cyanotic heart disease. Morphometric and
   cell population analyses of the carotid bodies from these eight
   patients and from those of the control population indicated that
   enlargement of the carotid bodies during normal or abnormal growth
   results from proportionate increases in lobule parenchyma and stroma.
   There was also an increase in the width and length of the lobules
   without an increase in the diameter of the cell cords or a change in
   the size or proportion of the chief cells. Growth and development of
   the carotid bodies were studied in a control group of 59 patients
   without chronic hypoxemia. There were no sex related differences in
   carotid body weights. The combined weight of the carotid bodies
   correlated most strongly with body weight, although there was some
   correlation with age and body length. A regression equation
   reflecting the data relating to body weight (BW) is: Combined weight
   of carotid bodies (in mg.) = 0.29 BW (in kg.) +3.0. Leukemic
   infiltrates were present in two patients with acute lymphocytic
   leukemia, and diffuse lymphocytic infiltration with nodule formation
   was present in one patient with mental retardation. Metaplastic
   cartilage was present in a carotid body of one patient.

EX The aim of this paper is to report in detail the clinical and
   pathological observations in a case of cystic fibrosis showing widely
   disseminated intravascular sickling.  To the best of our knowledge no
   case of cystic fibrosis associated with sickle cell trait has been
   reported in the literature.  A six month old infant who was diagnosed
   to have cystic fibrosis and sickle cell trait was presented and the
   literature was reviewed for this coexistence.

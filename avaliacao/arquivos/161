AB To compare the in vitro susceptibility of mucoid and nonmucoid
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa to gentamicin, 144 isolates of both mucoid
   and nonmucoid P aeruginosa were cultured from throat swab and
   sputum specimens from 29 patients with diagnosed cystic fibrosis.
   Mucoid forms of P aeruginosa from throat swab cultures were all
   susceptible to gentamicin, whereas only 85.5% of the mucoid strains
   from sputum cultures were susceptible.  Nonmucoid strains from
   throat swab and sputum cultures were 85.1% and 77.8% susceptible,
   respectively.  Since the differences in susceptibility between the
   four groups of organisms were not significant (P < 0.05), it was
   concluded that these data show no real differences in susceptibility
   to gentamicin between the mucoid and nonmucoid strains.

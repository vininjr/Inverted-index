EX We have measured fast moving components of haemoglobin (FMH) in nine
   children with cystic fibrosis without any clinical evidence of
   diabetes mellitus.  The nine patients with cystic fibrosis had a mean
   FMH of 9.3 which differed significantly from 97 controls with a mean
   FMH of 7.6.  There was no correlation between FMH and age or FMH and
   duration of disease.  The above results raise the question as to what
   extent the FMH is a reflection of hyperglycaemia or insulinopenia.

AB The diameters of circulating peripheral lymphocytes were measured in
   28 children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. These were compared
   with lymphocyte measurements in 68 normal children, 19 children with
   asthma, and 12 children with cystic fibrosis. The average diameter of
   lymphocytes in normal children was found to be 11.2 microns. In
   contrast, the average diameter of lymphocytes in juvenile rheumatoid
   arthritis was 12.7 microns (P less than 0.0001). There were more
   lymphocytes with a diameter of 13 to 15 microns in children with
   juvenile rheumatoid arthritis than in normal children.

AB Total amylase activity of serum and mixed saliva was studied in
   homozygotes and heterozygotes for mucoviscidosis and in healthy
   subjects. Mean serum total activity was 269.0 +/- 113.7 U/l in the
   homozygotes, exceeding in nearly 50% of the cases the values given in
   the literature and those observed in the normal controls. The
   difference against the control group was significant (P less than
   0.05). Mean serum total amylase activity of heterozygotes agreed with
   the mean value for the healthy group (203.5 +/- 79.5 U/l) without a
   significant difference. Total amylase activity in the saliva of
   homozygotes (148.700 +/- 65.700  U/l) was higher than in the
   heterozygotes /118.300 +/- 74.200 U/l) of the healthy children
   (51.700 +/- 26.500 U/l). The difference between the homozygous and
   healthy groups was strongly significant (P less than 0.01), and that
   between the heterozygous group and the combined healthy children and
   adult groups was also significant (P less than 0.05). In the
   heterozygotes, salivary amylase activity was slightly elevated but
   not significantly different from the control group and did not result
   in a change in serum total amylase activity.

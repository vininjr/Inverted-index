AB Schulz (1969) showed that the raised Na concentration in the sweat
   of children suffering from cystic fibrosis  was due to a defect in
   Na reabsorption in the duct epithelium, but somewhat surprisingly
   the transepithelial potential difference (p.d.) is the same as that
   in normal controls.  Na transport is also reduced in the chronically
   ligated salivary duct of the rabbit submandibular gland (Fraser &
   Smaje, 1978), and because p.d. is unaffected, the ligated gland may
   be a useful model of this aspect of cystic fibrosis.  Here we would
   like to report a further similarity to cystic fibrosis; duct
   ligation leads to goblet cell hyperplasia which also occurs in the
   salivary glands in cystic fibrosis (Lev & Spicer, 1965).  Sections
   of the salivary duct 6 microm thick were taken at 60 microm
   intervals from ducts which had been ligated for between 1 and 5
   weeks and from their contralateral controls following fixation by
   immersion.  Ligation resulted in an increase in luminal diameter by
   distension of the previously convoluted epithelium, but there was no
   significant change in epithelial surface area.  The number of cell
   layers appeared to have increased however and there was a
   proliferation of goblet cells.  The mucus in these cells was stained
   by alcian blue at pH 1 indicating the presence of sulphomucin.  The
   mean goblet cell density rose from 7.62 plus or minus 4.73 mm-2
   (mean plus or minus S.E. of the mean, n = 6) in controls to 114 plus
   or minus 49.6 in ligated ducts.  The transepithelial Na flux in the
   same ducts was reduced from 10.1 plus or minus 0.79 n-mole cm-2
   sec-1 to 1.6 plus or minus 0.84 while p.d. remained at -22 mV,
   similar to those results previously reported.  There was no
   significant correlation between the degree of diminution of Na
   transport and the density of goblet cells but there was a positive
   correlation (r = 0.90) between the number of goblet cells in the
   control and contralateral ligated ducts.

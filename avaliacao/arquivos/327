EX Physiotherapy for adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis is
   continued along the same lines as for younger patients, but certain
   modifications may be necessary to fit in with their changing needs.
   When patients are transferred from the care of the paediatrician to
   the thoracic physician it may be helpful for them to be admitted to
   hospital for reassessment.  During this admission, the opportunity
   can be taken to review the daily physiotherapy regimen with the
   patients and their parents.  Postural drainage, the use of aerosols,
   breathing exercises, long-term follow-up, complications (haemoptysis
   and spontaneous pneumothorax), the use of intermittent positive
   pressure breathing, and terminal care are discussed.

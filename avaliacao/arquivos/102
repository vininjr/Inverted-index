EX Dr. Conover and his colleagues reported no difference in the
   haemolytic activity of serum complement components C1-C9 of cystic
   fibrosis (C.F.) patients, obligate heterozygotes, and normal
   controls.  They also measured individual complement components by
   radial immunodiffusion and found a significant rise of C3 but no
   significant difference in C5 levels between these groups.  Using
   immunodiffusion kits from the same manufacturer and freshly
   obtained sera, we have observed quite different findings.  C5 was
   mildly elevated in 20 and more highly elevated in 25 of 56 C.F.
   patients, 2 to 29 years of age.  C5 was also elevated in 24 of 51
   parents of C.F. patients, 15 showing mild and 9 higher elevations,
   while 4 of 24 controls showed only mild elevation.  No correlation
   was observed between serum-C5 levels, and the age, sex, clinical
   severity of disease (judged by Shwachman-Kulczyki scores), sputum
   bacterial colonisation, and mode of treatment of the C.F. patients.
   The elevation of C3 and C5 in a majority of patients with C.F. and
   obligate heterozygotes is very interesting and is suggestive of
   certain genetic defect(s) in the complement activation system in
   this autosomal recessive disorder.

AB Primary peritonitis, rarely diagnosed preoperatively, is an uncommon
   disease accounting for 2.1% of all pediatric abdominal emergencies.
   It is often associated with urinary or hepatic pathology, the former
   the source of the infecting organism in the majority of cases, and
   presents with characteristic symptoms depending upon whether it
   occurs in infancy or childhood. The symptoms and signs which allow
   for a positive prospective diagnosis are illustrated by comparing
   this disease to those entities with which it is most often confused,
   e.g. diffuse peritonitis of other etiologies, and include a short
   duration of symptoms, associated urinary tract infection and an
   absence of free air on abdominal roentgenograms. In the past, gram
   positive organisms were the most common infecting agent; however, in
   this series gram negative bacteria accounted for 69% or the
   organisms. Antibiotics with a gram negative spectrum and exploratory
   laparotomy with appendectomy are the hallmarks of therapy, the latter
   replaced by abdominal tap only in the patient who satisfies the
   criteria for primary peritonitis and in whom an associated disease
   makes the risk of surgery prohibitive.

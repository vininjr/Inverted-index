AB Urinary adenosine 3':5' (cyclic) monophosphate and guanosine 3':5'
   (cyclic)-monophosphate excretion are significantly elevated in adult
   male cystic fibrosis patients compared to normal men when values are
   expressed in ways which consider the smaller size of the cystic
   fibrosis subjects of the same age. Cystic fibrosis patients excreted
   3.22 +/- 1.16 nmol adenosine 3':5' (cyclic)monophosphate/g creatinine
   per 24 h vs. 1.97 +/- 0.43 for normal men (p less than 0.02); and
   cystic fibrosis patients excreted 0.50 +/- 0.16 nmol guanosine 3':k'
   (cyclic)monophosphate/g creatinine per 24 h vs. 0.30 +/- 0.07 for
   normal men (p less than 0.05). Subjects were all adults who had
   completed linear growth and sexual development, thus eliminating any
   possible effects of slower maturation of cystic fibrosis patients,
   and all subjects were male, thus avoiding the fluctuation of urinary
   cyclic nucleotides with the menstrual cycle, problems which had
   complicated interpretation of previous studies.

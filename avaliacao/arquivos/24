AB The pressure-volume behavior of the lung was studied in 24 patients
   with cystic fibrosis.  Isovolume flow-pressure relationships were
   measured in 7 of these patients, and a modification of the
   flow-volume test was evaluated for detection of flow reduction in a
   separate group of 63 patients.  Relative to results in a control
   group of 31 normal subjects, 13 of the 24 patients had grossly
   abnormal pressure-volume curves with excessive stiffness of the lung
   near maximum volume and loss of recoil at lower volume.  Closing
   volumes in these patients were often high enough to cause
   significant disturbances in gas exchange and the elevated closing
   volumes were quantitatively explained by the low values for elastic
   recoil.  The modified flow-volume test detected mild flow reduction
   in many patients who otherwise had normal pulmonary function tests.
   Loss of recoil per se did not account for the low maximum expiratory
   flows, since "upstream" resistances were high.  However,
   pressure-flow curves were effort-dependent at high lung volumes even
   in patients with severe airway obstruction, showing that time
   constants of emptying varied widely in these patients.  It was
   concluded that deterioration of lung function in cystic fibrosis
   involves more than airway obstruction and that the worsening gas
   trapping is explained by a progressive loss of lung elastic recoil.

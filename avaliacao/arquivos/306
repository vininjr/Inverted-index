AB The ability of epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA)-treated normal serum
   and of cystic fibrosis (CF)-affected and carrier sera to promote the
   release of lysosomal enzymes from sensitized human polymorphonuclear
   leukocytes (PMN) was assessed through the measurement of beta-
   glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase activity after exposure of these
   cells to the various test sera. This study was initiated to extend
   the analogies between preciliary dyskinesia factor (pre-CDF),
   separated from the cell-free media of cultures derived from CF
   homozygous and heterozygous individuals, and C3a anaphylatoxin. The
   extent of lysosomal degranulation of human PMN exposed to fresh
   untreated sera of each of five controls, seven CF homozygotes, and
   eight heterozygotes, as expressed by the amount of beta-glucuronidase
   releases, was 7.84% (+/- 0.934) for control sera, 14.01% (+/- 1.79)
   for CF-affected sera, and 10.61% (+/- 1.43) for heterozygous sera.
   The difference between CF homozygotes and control subjects is
   significant (P less than 0.0001), as is the difference between CF-
   affected and carrier individuals (0.001 less than P less than 0.005)
   and between control subjects and carriers (0.001 less than P less
   than 0.005), when beta-glucuronidase. However, the differences
   between control subjects and CF heterozygous individuals are not
   significant. Treatment of these sera with 1 M EACA gave values for
   beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase release which are slightly
   reduced when compared with those obtained with fresh, untreated
   samples. EACA apparently reduces the activity of beta-glucuronidase
   released from PMN. Amicon filtration studies of these serum samples
   demonstrated that degranulating ability and the presence of cilicary
   dyskinesia, as assessed by rabbit tracheal bioassay, are not always
   associated. Therefore, the relationship between pre-CDF and the
   degranulator activity in native CF-affected and carrier sera is
   unclear, in part because of the limitations inherent in the test
   systems employed.

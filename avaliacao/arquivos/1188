AB Prone immersion physical exercise therapy has been used successfully
   in the physical rehabilitation of middle-aged adults with moderate to
   severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this
   pilot project was to evaluate the effects of PIPE therapy in children
   with cystic fibrosis. Three children with CF, two boys aged 6 and 14
   years and one girl aged 15 years, voluntarily participated in the
   experimental training program. The patients performed individualized
   group exercise three times a week on alternate days for 28
   consecutive weeks at an intensity of approximately 75 percent aerobic
   capacity. Duration of exercise gradually increased from 15 (3 x 5
   minutes) to 60 (3 x 20 minutes) minutes while the rest period after
   each exercise was constant at two minutes. PIPE training resulted in
   increased physical work capacity and maximal oxygen consumption in
   all three subjects. Curiously, these changes were not accompanied by
   training bradycardia.

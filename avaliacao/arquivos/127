AB A tool to assess psychosocial adjustment of school-age children with
   cystic fibrosis was developed using three instruments: a
   standardized open-ended parent interview, a self-administered
   teacher questionnaire, and a self-administered parent demographic
   data form.  The three instruments enabled the pediatric nurse
   practitioner to make a clinical assessment of the child's
   psychosocial adjustment.  This assessment was then checked for
   validity by means of a social worker interview.  Implications for
   further research are discussed.

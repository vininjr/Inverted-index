EX Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a generalized disorder of the exocrine glands
   inherited as a recessive genetic trait.  The disease was more fully
   described as a specific entity in 1939 with a pathology of dilated
   ducts and fibrotic changes in the pancreas and copious secretory
   intraluminal obstruction of the bronchial tree.  The symptoms
   predominately involve the gastrointestinal tract as more frequent,
   bulky, malformed and malodorous stools and the respiratory system as
   cough, wheezing and signs of chronic respiratory obstruction.  In
   certain instances, only one of these two systems will have manifest
   symptoms and signs.  An increased concentration of sodium and
   chloride in the sweat was discovered in 1953.  The elevated salt
   concentration of the sweat has proven to be a reliable diagnostic
   tool to confirm the presence of the disease.  Few diseases present in
   so many different forms, degrees of severity and at different ages as
   does CF.  All present treatments for cystic fibrosis are essentially
   symptomatic.  Since the study of families having a child with cystic
   fibrosis has shown an incidence of the disease in one fourth of their
   siblings, classification of the disease as an autosomal recessive
   genetic disorder suggests that the concept of an abnormal gene
   related to alteration in a single enzyme should apply.  The diagnosis
   of cystic fibrosis in childhood is an overwhelming even to the
   patient and his family.

AB The chronically reserpinized rat has been proposed as an animal
   model for cystic fibrosis on the basis of morphologic and secretory
   alterations in the submaxillary gland and of abnormalities in
   pulmonary secretions.  In this investigation, the volume and
   composition of pancreatic juice from reserpine treated rats (0.5
   mg/kg/day) have been compared to those of untreated controls after
   stimulation with purified cholecystokinin (0.1 microgram/kg body
   weight) and with crude and purified preparations of secretin (6
   microns/100 g body weight) infused iv for 30-min periods.  The
   results demonstrate that the treated animals secreted a
   significantly lower volume of pancreatic juice after stimulation
   with these secretagogues.  Flow rates were also significantly
   reduced after stimulation with cholecystokinin and crude secretin.
   Protein and amylase outputs in response to cholecystokinin were
   smaller than in control animals after unrestritced feedings, but
   greater after a 24-hr fast.  Total bicarbonate output was also
   reduced after stimulation with either crude or purified secretin and
   the normal excretion patterns for bicarbonate and chloride were
   either absent of reversed in the secretin-stimulated pancreatic
   juice of the treated animals.  Whole pancreas homogenates from the
   treated animals showed significant increases in Ca++ and protein
   content.  These results indicate that chronic administration of
   reserpine alters the secretion of water, protein, and bicarbonate
   from the rat pancreas and that it affects several of the exocrine
   glands involved in cystic fibrosis.  These findings lend support to
   the concept of an animal model for the human disease.  The chronic
   administration of reserpine to rats has been shown to induce
   alterations in salivary and pulmonary secretions which resemble
   those seen in patients with cystic fibrosis.  The concept of an
   animal model has been proposed on the basis of these observations.
   The pancreas is another exocrine gland prominently involved in
   cystic fibrosis and if it can be demonstrated that reserpine
   administration also induces alterations in pancreatic secretion, the
   concept of the animal model would be strengthened considerably.

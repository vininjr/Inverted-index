EX The aim of the present study is to reassess the peripheral pattern of
   thyroid function in subjects with cystic fibrosis with special
   reference to their responsiveness to thyrotropin-releasing hormone
   (TRH) stimulation.  In all the CF patients the basal levels of serum
   T4, T3, and TBG were within the normal range.  Mean values in CF
   patients and in control children were not significantly different.
   In CF patients there is no correlation between the TSH response area
   and the basal level of serum T4, or with grading according to
   Shwachman and Kulczycki.  We found no relation with therapy.  In
   basal conditions, our data show a completely normal pattern of the
   serum concentration of T4, T3, TBG and TSH in subjects with CF in
   absence of iodide therapy.  Thyroid status should be examined in
   patients with CF specially when they receive iodide therapy or other
   drugs which can enhance the impairment of thyroid function.

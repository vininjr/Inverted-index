EX Individually and collectively opinion is expressed that antibiotics
   are among the most frequently prescribed drugs in United States,
   probably also in many other countries.  While it is adopted by many
   that the increased longevity of cystic fibrosis patients is strongly
   related to antibiotic usage, this has never been documented
   adequately.  The principles which we try to follow while using
   antibiotics in CF patients are outlined.

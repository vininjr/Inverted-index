EX Few studies of serum proteins by means of paper electrophoresis in
   patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have been published.  In these
   studies alterations of the serum protein fractions were found, some
   of which were significantly correlated with the clinical and
   radiological severity of the disease.  In the present study, serum
   proteins determined by paper electrophoresis in 95 patients with CF
   have been studied and correlated with clinical and radiological
   findings.  The serum proteins and electrophoretic patterns if 95
   patients with CF were followed for 1 to 6 years in each patient.  For
   CF patients as a whole, total serum protein was unchanged, whereas
   albumin and albumin/globulin ratio were decreased and all globulin
   fractions increased.  Total serum protein was increased in patients
   with severe pulmonary disease.  The changes in total serum protein
   and in all protein fractions were significantly correlated with
   clinical and radiological severity of the lung disease.  All terminal
   patients had severe changes.  Patients with complicating liver
   cirrhosis had electrophoretic patterns that did not differ from those
   of other CF patients.  It is concluded that the main cause for serum
   protein alterations in CF is the lung affection, whereas liver
   involvement and malabsorption probably are of much less importance.

EX We have recently studied an 11-year-old child with proved cystic
   fibrosis in whom raised sweat sodium but normal sweat chloride
   levels were obtained while she was receiving cloxacillin.  There
   was no peripheral edema or hypoproteinemia, although at necropsy
   there was evidence of biliary cirrhosis.  Although the sweat
   abnormality might have been due to as yet unknown factors, the
   temporal association with cloxacillin administration suggests a
   causative relationship, and it is tempting to speculate that the
   anomaly was produced in this instance by the substitution of the
   cloxacillin radical for the chloride ion in the sweat during the
   period of therapy.  In light of our findings it would be of
   interest to know whether the infant reported by MacLean and Tripp
   was receiving any drugs at the time of the initial sweat chloride
   estimations and whether sodium estimations were also performed.

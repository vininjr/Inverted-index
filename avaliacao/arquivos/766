AB Diploid skin fibroblasts derived from several unrelated patients with
   cystic fibrosis (CF) were tested for resistance to the cytotoxic
   effects of ouabain in comparison with cells from normal individuals.
   Cells from CF and normal individuals were plated at low density and
   exposed to ouabain at different concentrations for 24 hr. Dose-
   response curves showed that CF cells survived significantly better
   than did normal cells at all ouabain concentrations from 0.1 nM to 1
   micronM in potassium-deficient medium. In medium containing the usual
   amount of potassium (6.25 mM), survival of the CF cells exposed to
   ouabain was decreased to that of the normal cells. If the glucose
   concentration of the potassium-deficient medium was decreased to 10%
   of the usual amount, the resistance of the CF cells to ouabain
   disappeared and their survival was identical to that of the normal
   cells. These findings may be useful in understanding the biochemical
   basis of CG and its clinical manifestations.

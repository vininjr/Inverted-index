EX Dr. Economou-Mavrou and his colleagues appear to have misunderstood
   my previous note concerning skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis.  The
   range of normality varies in different climatic conditions, and in
   Aukland wrinkling does not appear in cool tap-water (18-22 C) under
   3 minutes in normals.  Skin wrinkling on immersion appears to be
   age-related, but is difficult to detect reliably in the newborn.
   Prior washing of the hands, or immersion in sea-water (even the day
   before), accelerates skin wrinkling, as does warm weather.  I would
   suggest that "normality" needs redefining in Athens if 6 of 17
   "normals" were "abnormal".

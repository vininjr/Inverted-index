EX The papers by Elliott and by Campbell et al. suggest a new approach
   toward etiology, pathophysiology, and therapy in patients with cystic
   fibrosis.  As in Elliott's original report of the effects of
   intravenous fatty acid therapy for CF, the patients in the present
   report fared remarkably well, particularly in regard to weight gain.
   The paper of Campbell et al. suggests that oxygen does not simply
   diffuse across membranes, but that instead its transport is
   influenced by the fatty acid composition of the membrane.  Elliott's
   suggestion that the disarranged fatty acid metabolism may be related
   to altered prostaglandin production is attractive.  These studies do
   not prove whether fatty acid and/or prostaglandin alterations are
   secondary to intestinal fat malabsorption or are related to the
   primary metabolic defect in CF.

EX In a situation in which a patient, currently undergoing medical
   treatment at home requiring compliance and fairly rigid discipline
   for its effectiveness, is found by the health visitor not to be
   carrying out the prescribed treatment, should the health visitor's
   role always be to attempt to influence the patient to comply with the
   required treatment or are there occasions when it might be acceptable
   for her to disregard this positive role?  To illustrate such a
   situation, the real-life experience of two families will be
   discussed.

AB Sections of pancreas from 16 individuals who died with cystic
   fibrosis (CF) were classified by morphometric criteria into four
   categories in increasing order of pancreatic involvement. The
   concentration of acini, islets, main ducts, lobular ducts, connective
   tissue, and fat was compared with control levels. The results show
   that in the least involved pancreases, from neonates who died under 5
   months of age, acini were reduced to 33% of control levels and the
   following were increased: islets, to 410%, lobular ducts, to 250%;
   and main ducts, to 1700% of controls. With increasing severity of the
   pancreatic disease the acini were further reduced to 5% and lobular
   ducts to 37% of control levels, respectively. Main ducts increased by
   19-fold, and fatty infiltration accounted for more than 25% of the
   fresh weight of the pancreas in 9 of the 16 specimens. Comparative
   biochemical studies of 35 fibrocystic pancreases were quantitatively
   related to the severity of the pancreatic involvement as follows.
   Water and volatile matter, normally accounting for 80 +/-% of the
   weight of the fresh pancreas, was reduced to less than 30% in the
   most affected organs. The concentration of zinc diminished from near
   normal mean levels of 193 mugZn/g dry pancreas to 10% of this amount
   in the severely involved pancreas. Elevated concentrations of
   calcium, amounting to over 10 times control level, were found in
   obstructed ductal structures. Calcium was depleted from pancreatic
   sections adjacent to the obstructions. The following biochemical
   indicators were significantly different in their mean levels in the
   35 fibrocystic pancreases when compared with the 17 controls: (P less
   than or equal to 0.001) fat, water, zinc, calcium, copper, magnesium,
   potassium, and sodium (P less than or equal to 0.01).

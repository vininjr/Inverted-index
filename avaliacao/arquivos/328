EX Cystic fibrosis is a genetically determined disorder.  The evidence
   that cystic fibrosis is inherited in this way comes from several
   sources.  The birth frequency of cystic fibrosis is unexpectedly high
   in Britain for such a serious illness.  It is easy to calculate the
   proportion of the population who are carriers from the birth
   frequency of the disease.  The explanation of the unlikely high birth
   frequency of cystic fibrosis in Europe is not known.  An attempt to
   reduce substantially the birth frequency of cystic fibrosis will
   become possible once it is practicable to detect reliably the carrier
   of the gene.

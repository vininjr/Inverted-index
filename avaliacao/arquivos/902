EX "Hereditary pancreatitis" is important for at least three reasons:
   (1) It is probably not an uncommon form of pancreatitis in children
   and young adults; (2) the course of the disorder may be chronic, with
   substantial long-term morbidity, including an apparently increased
   risk for pancreatic cancer; and (3) once having made the correct
   diagnosis, occurrence among siblings and/or offspring (and perhaps
   other relatives) of the proband may be expected.  Hereditary
   pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant trait with apparently complete
   penetrance, though markedly variable expressivity.  It would be
   reasonable to point out that hereditary pancreatitis should be
   entertained whenever an alternative diagnosis is not documented, even
   without a positive family history. - We agree with the statement by
   Jordan and Ament in a recent article that "acute pancreatitis is one
   of the rarer causes of abdominal pain in children and is among the
   least reported and characterized."  However, their discussion of this
   problem is surprisingly incomplete.  Familial pancreatitis, one of
   the most important causes of pancreatitis in childhood, is not even
   mentioned; cystic fibrosis is barely acknowledged.  These two
   conditions as well as hypolipoproteinemia and ascariasis (also not
   mentioned) should be included in the differential diagnosis of
   pancreatitis in children and of otherwise unexplained abdominal pain
   in this age group. - We appreciate the concern that we did not
   diagnose hereditary pancreatitis in any of our patients.  None of the
   ten patients with "idiopathic pancreatitis" had a family history of
   pancreatitis documented in their charts.  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is not
   a common cause of pancreatitis in our center.  We chose to omit
   ascariasis from our differential diagnosis because in the developed
   countries it is unlikely to be a common cause of pancreatitis.

AB We have shown that skin fibroblast from patients with cystic fibrosis
   (CF) and from carriers for CF [heterozygotes (HZ)] consume more O2
   than do their controls. When the mitochondrial electron transport
   inhibitor rotenone was added to the cells, the relative inhibition of
   O2 consumption was CF greater than HZ greater than controls (P less
   than 0.005 in both comparisons). Because rotenone specifically
   inhibits NADH dehydrogenase, [NADH: (acceptor) oxidoreductase, EC
   1.6.99.3], which is the enzyme of energy-conserving site 1 of the
   mitochondrial electron transport system, activity and kinetics of
   this enzyme system were studied in fibroblast homogenates. NADH
   dehydrogenase activity was equal in cells from the three genotypes.
   At pH 8.0, affinity of the enzyme for its substrate was CF greater
   than HZ = controls; at pH 8.6, affinity was CF greater than HZ =
   controls (P less than 0.005 for the differences). pH optima for the
   genotypes were without exception 8.6 (CF), 8.3 (HZ), and 8.0
   (control). HZ and control lines were distinguished unequivocally in a
   blind test on the basis of differences in pH optima. Purified
   mitochondrial preparations revealed pH optima identical to those
   found in whole cell homogenates. These data suggest that the mutant
   gene responsible for CF is expressed in the complex mitochondrial
   NADH dehydrogenase system.

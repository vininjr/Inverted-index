EX We describe two infants with previously undiagnosed cystic fibrosis
   who had electrolyte depletion, metabolic alkalosis, and dehydration
   in the winter and three infants known to have CF in whom similar
   manifestations developed.  We confirm previous reports that salt
   depletion and metabolic alkalosis do occur throughout the year in the
   northern United States and England.  When metabolic alkalosis and
   hypoelectrolytemia in infancy are not explained on the basis of other
   clinical conditions, CF should be suspected.  Pediatricians should
   measure serum electrolyte values promptly and consider early
   parenteral fluid and electrolyte therapy as a preventive measure for
   infants with CF with persistent vomiting and/or diarrhea.

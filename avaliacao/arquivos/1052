AB The sweat test, correctly performed, appears to be reliable, but
   results were found to be unreliable about half the time in 84 small
   community hospitals assessed. The reasons are inexperienced and
   untrained technicians, the infrequency of test performance, the use
   of unstandardized equipment, and the lack of appropriate standards.
   It behooves all clinical laboratory directors to re-examine and
   standardize their procedures and use the recommendations of the
   Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Physicians should be made aware of the
   current situation and send their patients only to laboratories that
   perform the test reliably.

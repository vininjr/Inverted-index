AB Using a micro-method for the determination of plasma arginine
   esterase activity, we have investigated the values for soybean
   trypsin inhibitor (STI)-inhibited arginine esterase activity in
   patients with cystic fibrosis, obligate heterozygotes and age matched
   control individuals. The mean of STI-inhibited activity is lowest for
   cystic fibrosis patients while the mean for normal controls is the
   highest. The mean of STI-inhibited activity for the heterozygotes is
   midway between the values of the patients and the normal individuals.
   The deficiency of arginine esterase activity was statistically
   significant for both cystic fibrosis patients and heterozygotes.

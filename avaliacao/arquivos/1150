AB In 17 children (group A) with cystic fibrosis (CF) the effect of the
   following treatment schedules on pulmonary function has been studied in
   random order on 4 consecutive days: (1) clapping and postural drainage
(CP);
   (2) CP after inhaling an aerosol of 5 ml 20% N-acetylcysteine by a Monaghan
   ultrasonic device; (3) as in 2 but with the addition of 0.5 mg isoprenaline
   to the aerosol; (4) as in 3 but with an IPPB device added to the nebulizer.
   Treatment was started at 9.30 a.m. and lasted for about 1 h.  Pulmonary
   function was measured prior to and 30 min after treatment (9.00 and 11.00
   a.m., respectively).  In 8 children (group B) with CF (severity comparable
   to the previous group) pulmonary function was measured at 9.00 and 11.00
a.m.
   but without physiotherapy in between.  The following pulmonary function
   measurements have been included in the evaluation of the results: VC, FVC,
   FEV1, TLC (body box), TLC (helium dilution), TLCBb-TLCHe, RVBb, RVHe,
maximal
   expiratory flows at 60% TLBBb, 25% FVC, maximal midexpiratory flow, airway
   conductance.  The technique of the determinations was carefully controlled
   and initial values were reproducible in most children.  In group B, mean
   values of pulmonary function were equal at 9.00 and 11.00 a.m.  In group
A
   none of the treatment schedules caused a significant improvement of mean
   pulmonary function values.  In some of the children, however, pulmonary
   function improved, but in others it deteriorated. The significance of these
   findings was discussed.

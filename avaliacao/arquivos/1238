EX We theorize that cystic fibrosis may be a disease in which a plasma
   factor with lectin-like activity stimulates mucus secretion, causes
   precipitation of mucus glycoproteins, and incidentally affects
   lymphocytes in culture.  To confirm our theory, we planned to search
   for additional lectin-like activities in CF serum.  Our experiments
   suggest that the lectin-like substance in CF blood requires IgM for
   its red-blood-cell-agglutination activity.  Thus, no difference in
   agglutination titer is observed between CF homozygotes and
   heterozygotes, because IgM is the limiting factor, and IgM
   concentrations do not differ appreciably in such subjects.  We
   suspect that CF homozygotes have a larger pool of free lectin in
   their blood than do heterozygotes, so that quantitation of this free
   lectin pool may distinguish between the two phenotypes.  Excess free
   lectin may account for the signs and symptoms of CF, whereas lesser
   amounts may theoretically be advantageous to the heterozygote.

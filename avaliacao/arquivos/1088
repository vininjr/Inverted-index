EX Inborn errors of metabolism are conditions in which the body fails to
   metabolise certain chemicals due to an inherited enzyme deficiency.
   The inborn errors of metabolism considered in this paper are those
   which affect the metabolism of dietary nutrients and which require
   manipulation of the carbohydrate intake.  In these cases the need for
   sugar - either as a source of energy when other energy-supplying
   nutrients have to be suppressed, or for the control of hypoglycaemia
   - is vitally important.  Inborn errors of protein metabolism include
   phenylketonuria, maple-syrup urine disease, organic acidaemias, and
   hyperammonaemia.  Inborn errors of fat metabolism  include
   abetalipoprotinaemia, type I lipoprotein-lipase deficiency, and
   lymphangiectasia.  Inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism include
   diabetes, galactosaemia, fructosaemia, and glucose-6-phosphate
   deficiency (type I glycogen storage disease).  Inborn errors of
   multiple nutrients include cystic fibrosis.  Dietary carbohydrate,
   psychological considerations, and dental caries are examined.

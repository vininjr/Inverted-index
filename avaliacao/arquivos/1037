EX The combination of chronic pulmonary sepsis and pancreatic
   insufficiency in children with cystic fibrosis may lead to
   malnutrition.  We describe our experience of the long-term use of
   continuous nocturnal infusion of elemental diet in a patient with
   cystic fibrosis.  Our patient tolerated the long-term nocturnal
   elemental diet well, and it enabled her to continue normal
   everyday activity and eat normal meals.  The periods of nutritional
   support coincided with periods of increased body weight and total
   body potassium, indicating that the lean body mass was increased.
   We think that these results show a need for further studies of home
   treatment in children with cystic fibrosis.

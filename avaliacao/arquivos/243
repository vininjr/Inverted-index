AB Metachromasia of cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with cystic
   fibrosis (CF), and the assignment of the fibroblasts to one of
   three classes after the morphological distribution of the
   metachromatic staining, have been described by Danes and Bearn
   (1968, 1969) and Danes (1969).  In two previous studies from this
   hospital (Lykkegaard & Jacobsen 1975, Lykkegaard & Thuesen Pedersen
   1975) the clinical, radiological, and functional severity of the
   lung disease and the serum protein pattern in CF patients were
   studied in relation to classes of skin fibroblast metachromasia.  It
   was found that class III patients tended to be more severely
   affected than class II patients, and more than class I + II
   patients, and, possibly, class I patients were also more severely
   affected than class II patients.  Sproul and Huang (1964), in a
   study of growth patterns in cystic fibrosis, found a significant
   correlation between severity of the respiratory disease and height
   and weight retardation.  In the present study, height and weight
   development in 98 CF patients are correlated with class of skin
   fibroblast metachromasia.

AB An ear-nose-throat survey was carried out on 50 children aged 4 to
   10 years with cystic fibrosis.  10% were shown to be transiently
   deaf, associated with eustachian tube dysfunction.  There were no
   confirmed cases of secretory otitis media.  10 children (20%) were
   found to have nasal polyps or gave a history of polypectomy.  Though
   a high incidence of middle ear problems in children with cystic
   fibrosis has been reported in the U.S.A., neither deafness nor
   secretory otitis media was found to be a problem in the group
   studied.

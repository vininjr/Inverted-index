AB Vitamin A absorption tests using vitamin A palmitate and alcohol
   separately in oil and oil-water emulsions were done on 43 patients
   with cystic fibrosis. Patients were given 7,000 units of vitamin A
   per kilogram of body weight with a fatty breakfast. Pancreatic
   enzymes were not given with the test meal and were withheld for five
   hours from start of test. Blood was drawn before administration of
   the vitamin and at three and five hours after administration. Serum
   vitamin A levels were estimated using the Carr-Price technique. The
   percentages of patients with normal vitamin A absorption were 85 with
   vitamin A alcohol in oil-water emulsion, 61 with vitamin A alcohol
   dissolved in oil, 64 with vitamin A palmitate in oil-water emulsion,
   and 19 with vitamin A palmitate in oil. The number of stools per day
   is an inverse indicator of retention time in the intestine.
   Absorption of fat soluble vitamins is always abnormal when a patient
   has four or more stools a day. The observations that cystic fibrosis
   patients with abnormal liver biopsies have poor absorption of vitamin
   A were not statistically significant. The question of the effect of
   cirrhosis in cystic fibrosis on vitamin A absorption remains
   unresolved.

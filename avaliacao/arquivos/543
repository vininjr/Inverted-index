AB This study examined the effect of aerosolized isoproterenol and oral
   theophylline on pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis (CF) to
   determine how often these drugs are beneficial and whether there is a
   correlation between response to isoproterenol and response to oral
   theophylline. After obtaining baseline pulmonary function tests
   before and after isoproterenol aerosol, 12 patients with CF were put
   on a double-blind trial of high-dosage theophylline (10 mg/kg three
   times per day) or placebo for four weeks and were then switched to
   the alternate regimen for the next four weeks. Patients had weekly
   evaluations of pulmonary function and plasma theophylline
   determinations. Gastrointestinal side effects were common with
   theophylline. The responses to aerosolized bronchodilators were
   inconsistent from week to week. After aerosolized bronchodilator,
   five of 12 patients had an average increase of 10% or more in FEF45%-
   55% and FEF70%-80%. While taking oral theophylline, five patients had
   a 10% or more decrease in FEF 45%-55% and six patients had a decrease
   in FEF70%-80%. We conclude that there was no concordance between
   response to isoproterenol and theophylline, and that adrenergic and
   methylxanthine drugs must be used with caution in patients with CF.

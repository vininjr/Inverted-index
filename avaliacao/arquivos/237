EX Many types of lung disease are seen in the pediatric age group.
   These range all the way from disorders of the neonate that are
   closely related to parturition, to acute infectious diseases seen in
   infancy and early childhood, to chronic disorders such as cystic
   fibrosis and bronchial asthma.  Management of the conditions
   described involves cooperation between the primary care physician and
   the specialist.  A variety of organizations offers aid to both
   physicians and patients' families.

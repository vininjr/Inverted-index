EX We have read with interest the report by Elliott and Robinson
   concerning the apparent beneficial effects of intravenous fat
   infusions in a child with cystic fibrosis.  We question whether the
   increase in essential fatty acids brought about by soya oil can
   account for the favourable course of the disease in this patient.
   Our own observations confirm that essential fatty acids levels are
   often below normal in cystic fibrosis, but they do not correlate
   with the clinical condition of the patient.  It seems unlikely that
   minor degrees of essential fatty acid deficiency would impair
   prostaglandin synthesis, or give rise to the usual clinical features
   of cystic fibrosis. - Our own more recent research in platelet
   aggregation, prostaglandin, and cyclic nucleotide production, makes
   us aware that simple EFA deficiency per se cannot be the origin of
   the symptoms of CF.  The possibility that some other agent in the
   infusion mixture (which, for example, contains about 12% tocopherol)
   may be a contributing factor, is also under investigation.  This
   does not, however, invalidate a possible therapeutic effect of EFA
   in the disease, and in particular, a partial correlation of a
   possible disorder of prostaglandin synthesis.

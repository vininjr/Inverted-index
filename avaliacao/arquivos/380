AB Faecal specimens from 51 infants free of cystic fibrosis (CF) and
   from 9 infants with the disease were analysed for albumin and alpha1-
   antitrypsin content. Faeces from infants with no CF had a mean
   albumin content of less than 0-1 mg/g dry weight and a mean albumin:
   alpha1-antitrypsin ratio value of less than 0-1. Faeces from infants
   with CF had, with one exception, an albumin content of more than 2-0
   mg/g dry weight and a ratio value greater than 3-0. It was
   subsequently found that the duodenal aspirate from the child with CF
   but whose faeces had a low albumin content and ratio value, had
   tryptic activity though at a much reduced level compared to the
   activity in aspirates from healthy infants.

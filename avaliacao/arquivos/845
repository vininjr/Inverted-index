EX To learn how families cope with cystic fibrosis, we interviewed 18
   families who gave us vivid descriptions of the day-to-day process of
   living with this devastating disease.  The families and the disease
   are described.  Pre-diagnosis and diagnosis, home management and
   treatment, family communication about CF, the reactions of siblings,
   relationships with peers, hospitalization, and sources of support are
   discussed.

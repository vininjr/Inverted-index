AB The biliary tree of 66 patients with cystic fibrosis was examined by
   conventional roentgenographic methods. Forty-five per cent of the
   oral cholecystograms were judged abnormal by our criteria. A study
   was considered abnormal if there was no visualization or if there was
   visualization of a microgallbladder or structural abnormality
   including marginal irregularities, septate gallbladder or
   cholelithiasis. Intravenous cholangiography was used to further study
   the 22 patients who did not visualize on the oral study. Again,
   anatomic abnormalities were prevalent but six patients in this group
   had normal appearing gallbladders. Abdominal pain, a frequent symptom
   in cystic fibrosis, was not associated with roentgenographic
   abnormality. No correlation was seen between the external biliary
   tree abnormalities and multifocal biliary cirrhosis which was present
   in 40% of these patients. Further, no correlation was seen between
   serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase levels and either of these
   lesions.

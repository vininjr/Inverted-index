AB The levels of galactosyltransferase have been studied in the sera
   obtained from 59 normal individuals varying in age from 5 - 19
   years, and from 29 cystic fibrosis patients varying in age from
   5 - 33 years.  The enzyme level found in children was lower than
   that in adults.  The levels in the sera of cystic fibrosis patients
   was found to be about half of that in the normal sera for the
   corresponding age group.  In those cystic fibrosis patients over 20
   years of age, normal levels were found.

EX We have obtained additional data which support the specificity of the
   reported serum glutathione reductase (GR) changes in cystic fibrosis
   (CF).  As in previous series, mean GR in CF was 20% greater than in
   controls (P < 0.005).  No difference was found between CF and
   controls for either lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or glutamic-pyruvic
   transaminase (GPT).  It appears that some underlying process or
   processes such as leakage into serum from cellular damage as
   reflected in raised LDH and GPT might lead to raised GR as
   demonstrated by positive correlations in controls.  The absence of a
   positive correlation between these enzymes and GR in the CF sample as
   well as normal values for LDH and GPT in CF suggests that the raised
   serum GR in CF is not attributable to tissue leakage from damaged
   cells secondary to the disease.

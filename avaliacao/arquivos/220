EX We wish to draw the attention of your readers to a possible hazard
   of feeding infants with an elemental diet.  Considerable interest is
   currently being shown in the use of the artificial diet in cystic
   fibrosis.  It may be used as a supplement to ordinary food or to
   supply all the nutritional needs of the child.  In the latter event
   we believe that it is particularly important to emphasize to the
   parents the need for an additional source of dietary fat.  Clinical
   evidence and animal experiments suggest that infants, because of
   their rapid growth rate, are particularly at risk and that in the
   absence of dietary E.F.A. they will develop deficiency symptoms in
   about two months.

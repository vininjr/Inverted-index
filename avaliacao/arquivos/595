EX Studies have shown that children with chronic illnesses are more
   prone to develop secondary handicaps in the areas of educational
   achievement, behavior, and psychological maladjustment than are
   'normal' children.  Besides his physical symptoms, the child with a
   chronic illness must endure prolonged hospitalization, psychological
   stresses, decreased activity, and is often denied opportunity for
   skill practice and peer group activities.  All these factors result
   in an overall decrease in sensory stimulation which could impair
   perceptual-motor functioning as well as the child's ability to
   successfully adapt to his disease.  Therefore, the purpose of this
   research was to obtain a general idea of the perceptual-motor or
   sensory integrative development of children with CF, to determine if
   there is, in fact, a need for sensory integrative treatment in the
   care of these children.

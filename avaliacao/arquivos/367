AB Prior genetic studies of the human pancreatic amylase (Amy2) locus
   have been directed principally to the electrophoretic analysis of
   serum and urine, on the assumption that these fluids receive
   negligible contributions from the salivary (Amy 1) locus. In support
   of that assumption was the observation that the isozyme bands were
   lacking in patients with cystic fibrosis and in a postpancreatectomy
   patient. We have examined the sera of 97 patients having cystic
   fibrosis and find normal levels of serum amylase. On electrophoresis,
   three-quarters of the cystic fibrosis patients have a pattern (F-
   pattern) not observed in normal sera. The pattern is characterized by
   the absence of Pa 1. Comparative electrophoresis and mixing
   experiments indicate that the F-pattern is of salivary origin and is
   unmasked in cystic fibrosis by the absence of a pancreatic
   contribution. The normal serum pattern is considered to be an
   admixture of salivary and pancreatic amylase. On the assumption that
   duodenal fluids might more closely reflect the pancreatic (Amy 2)
   locus, electrophoretic studies were performed on 148 normal
   individuals and 37 individuals with cystic fibrosis. Electrophoretic
   phenotypes in duodenal aspirates are more complex than previously
   reported in studies of urine and serum; presumably because of the
   higher concentrations of amylase in the aspirates. Comparative
   electrophoresis and mixing experiments indicate that the phenotypes
   observed in duodenal aspirates also reflect admixture of pancreatic
   and salivary amylase. This recognition of pancreatic and salivary
   admixture in sera fortunately does not alter our prior understanding
   of the genetics of the Amy 2 polymorphism. The extensive studies
   which led to the delineation of the Amy 2 polymorphism were
   essentially based on the presence or absence of a variant band which
   proves now to be outside the zone of admixture.

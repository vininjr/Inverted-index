AB An investigation of sweat chloride with chloride electrode Orion 417
   in normal persons and in patients with cystic fibrosis.  Sweat
   chloride values examined with Orion 417 direct-reading skin
   electrode were collected in a group of 811 normal persons and a
   group of 91 patients with cystic fibrosis and were evaluated for
   differences attributable to age and sex.  In the normal group no
   significant difference was found between the two sexes.  In the
   normal group the values among newborns are found to be considerably
   higher than in the rest of childhood.  During the first month of
   life the values decrease to a steady level, which is maintained from
   the age of 1 month to 15 years.  After the age of 15 a steady
   increase takes place.  With data gathered from the normal group we
   propose the following upper limits of "normal" for the sweat
   chloride test: 1 month - 15 years: Chloride 40 meq/l.  16 - 25
   years: Chloride 55 meq/l.  Upon examination of the Cystic Fibrosis
   group, the sweat chloride values in all age groups were found to be
   above the upper limits of normal.  The method is found valuable for
   large scale screening purposes for Cystic Fibrosis.

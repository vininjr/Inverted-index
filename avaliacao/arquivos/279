EX Lieberman reported that there was considerable overlap in
   quantitative C3 levels between all of the C.F. subjects tested, and
   the control group.  His control group, however, was composed of
   subjects with bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis, in whom C.F. had
   been ruled out.  The use of a more proper control group by
   Lieberman, either in place of or in parallel with his "diseased"
   control groups, would have provided a more meaningful interpretation
   concerning the role of complement in cystic fibrosis.  We agree that
   there is a tendency for C3 to be higher in C.F. females than in C.F.
   males.  Although Lieberman was quick to dispel any notion of C3a
   being implicated in the aetiology of C.F., he overlooked the one
   facet of our initial study that still makes our hypothesis feasible
   - raised C3 levels in C.F. obligate heterozygotes.  Hann et al.
   reported that serum-C5 was raised in both C.F. patients and their
   parents.  Our initial data on C5 levels by radial immunodiffusion
   and haemolytic studies do not confirm this finding.  We are
   supporting the hypothesis that C.F. is either a complement-caused or
   complement-mediated disorder, in which a C3a-like molecule (C3a,
   bradykinin) either alone or by complexing with IgG gives rise to the
   physiological and pathological state of C.F.

AB Safety and antigenicity of monovalent and bivalent A/New
   Jersey/NJ)/76 (HssN1) and A/Victoria/75 inactivated influenza virus
   vaccines were studied in 125 children aged three to 18 years. In
   recruitment, families who knew the study team, who were
   professionally involved, and/or who were under close continuing care
   were more likely to volunteer for such studies than those who were
   unfamiliar with the team or institution. Antibody responses and
   systemic reactions occurred more often after administration of
   inactivated whole-virus vaccine than after split-virus vaccine.
   Significant titers (greater than or equal to 1:40) of
   hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody to A/NJ/76 virus occurred in 95%
   of normal children three to 18 years of age who received two doses of
   the same vaccine (whole or split). However, insufficient numbers of
   children achieved a reasonable antibody titer (greater than or equal
   to 1:40) after one dose of vaccine.

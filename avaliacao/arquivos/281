EX Mr Stuart and Dr Burdon speculate on the possibility that the high
   frequency of the cystic-fibrosis gene among Caucasians may be due to
   the heterozygotes having some advantage in biological fitness over
   normal homozygotes.  They suggest that this might be due to
   increased resistance to typhus, once endemic in Europe, on the basis
   of the well-known immunological cross-reactivity between the
   causative organism, Rickettsia prowazeki, and certain strains of the
   species Proteus vulgaris, which is agglutinated by sera from
   cystic-fibrosis patients and heterozygotes.  However, there is no
   evidence that this agglutination is an immunological reaction.  It
   appears microscopically to be associated with disorganisation and
   inhibition of the bacterial flagellae leading to clumping of the
   organisms.  As such it is probably analogous to the effect on cilia
   of rabbit trachea and oyster or mussel gills.  The cilia factor,
   although associated with IgG, is now known not to be IgG itself and
   may well be the C3a component of complement.  These and other
   observations, such as those on salivary and sweat gland secretions
   and on sodium flux, suggest that all these phenomena are membrane
   rather than immunological effects.  Although it is possible that a
   Proteus flagella antigen could also be the binding site for the
   cilia factor, this seems improbable.  An alternative hypothesis is
   that heterozygotes for the cystic-fibrosis gene have increased
   resistance to tuberculosis.  This would meet the requirement of a
   common disease recently endemic in Europe at least as well as
   typhus, and is suggested by indirect evidence from a family study
   demonstrating a significantly lower incidence of tuberculosis among
   the parents of cystic-fibrosis patients than among parents of
   controls.

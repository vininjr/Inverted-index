AB Seventeen black patients showed typical sweat gland,
   gastrointestinal, and pulmonary manifestations of cystic fibrosis.
   There was an unusually high incidence of meconium ileus equivalent
   (35%). Three infant siblings of patients in this study had died of
   cystic fibrosis prior to referral of a family member to this center.
   One patient died at age four years after emotional problems
   interfered with the treatment program; status asthmaticus played a
   major role in his terminal respiratory failure. The remainder of the
   patients have had substantially less morbidity from pulmonary disease
   than a comparable, much larger group of white patients. Only one
   patient, age 28, who is married and employed full-time has severe
   pulmonary involvement as assessed by pulmonary function studies and
   chest roentgenogram. The 16 surviving patients have a mean age of 13
   1/2 years after a mean follow-up period of 10 years. If black
   patients with cystic fibrosis survive infancy, they then, as a group,
   may have a relatively good prognosis.

AB Plasma arginine esterase activity was measured in 13 young adult
   patients with cystic fibrosis and in 36 control subjects.  The
   enzyme was activated by treating the plasma with chloroform and
   ellagic acid in the manner described by Rao and associates (1).  No
   difference was found either between the arginine esterase activities
   of the patients with cystic fibrosis and the control subjects, or
   between the degrees of activity inhibited by soybean trypsin
   inhibitor.  Thus, the findings of Rao and associates of a deficiency
   of arginine esterase activity in the plasma of patients with cystic
   fibrosis were not confirmed.

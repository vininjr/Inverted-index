AB Changes in the nitrogen concentration seen during the single-breath
   nitrogen washout reflect changes in relative flow (V) from units with
   differing ventilation/volume ratios (V/V0). The multiple-breath
   washout provides sufficient data for the V for units with varying
   V/V0 to be plotted as a function of the volume expired. Flow from the
   dead space may also be determined. In young normals the emptying
   patterns are narrow and unimodal throughout the alveolar plateau with
   little or no flow from the dead space at the end of the breath. Older
   normals show more flow from the dead space, particularly toward the
   end of the breath, and some show a high V/V0 mode early in the
   breath. Patients with obstructive lung disease have a high flow from
   the dead space which is present throughout the breath. A well
   ventilated mode at the end of the breath is seen in some obstructed
   subjects. Patients with cystic fibrosis showed a poorly ventilated
   mode appearing at the end of the breath as well as a very high dead
   space.

AB Nitrogen- and lipid absorption coefficients were studied in 62
   patients with cystic fibrosis, aged 2/12 to 12 years, and compared
   with the results obtained in 20 normal children.  In 59 of the 62
   patients nitrogen- and lipid absorption were grossly abnormal.
   Age-linked differences were not found.  The efficacy of two
   pancreatic enzymes preparations was found to be similar.  Both
   preparations produced the same significant improvement in the
   absorption of proteins and lipids.

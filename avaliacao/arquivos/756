EX Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas is a recessively inherited disorder
   generally considered to result in chronic pulmonary or digestive
   symptoms.  Therefore, it may not be readily appreciated that this
   disease can also present with anemia, edema, and hypoproteinemia,
   especially in infants taking breast milk or soy-based formulas.  The
   following example involving monozygotic twins given cow's milk
   formula since birth will serve to illustrate this association.

AB The cytoplasmic metachromasia phenomenon with Toluidine Blue 0 in
   cultured skin fibroblasts was studied in 12 parents of children with
   cystic fibrosis and in 12 controls.  Positive findings were recorded
   in 10 of the CF parents and in one of the controls.  The average
   culture time required for development of maximum metachromasia in
   positive cases was six weeks.  The possible significance of the
   ametachromatic CF patients in relation to the suggested genetic
   heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis is discussed.

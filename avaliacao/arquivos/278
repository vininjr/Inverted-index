EX I have measured the fatty-acid profile of C.F. erythrocyte membranes
   in view of the fact that some variations in membrane activity have
   been observed with this system.  The results show that there was a
   lowered content of linoleate (18:2) and arachidonate (20:4) in C.F.
   erythrocyte membranes, and the total essential-fatty-acid content
   was significantly lower than either control group.  There was no
   significant difference in the concentrations of the other major
   fatty acids (palmitate, stearate, and oleate) and we could not
   observe any striking alteration in the concentration of any of the
   minor fatty-acid components of the membrane.  It would thus appear
   that the overall fatty-acid pattern in C.F. erythrocyte membranes is
   altered only by a diminution in those fatty acids which are of
   dietary origin.  The fact that there was considerable overlap
   between the C.F. and control data makes it rather unlikely that the
   fatty-acid profile closely reflects the biochemical lesion of the
   disease.  When the essential-fatty-acid levels of the C.F. samples
   were compared with the Schwachman clinical scores of the patients,
   there was a surprisingly poor correlation (r = 0.49) which was not
   statistically significant.  The correlation with the nutritional
   part of the clinical score was equally low.  Diminished
   essential-fatty-acid content is often observed in many acute
   illnesses.  In addition, the possibility exists that C.F. patients
   may be particularly susceptible to essential-fatty-acid depletion
   due to their pancreatic dysfunction.  Further research on fatty-acid
   transport and metabolism in C.F. is clearly needed to establish the
   role of essential fatty acids in the disease.

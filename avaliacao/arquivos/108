AB Previous studies on cystic fibrosis (C.F.) have shown increased
   mucopolysaccharide synthesis in C.F. cells.  The uptake of
   35S-heparin sulphonate into purified lymphocytes was examined after
   3 days' culture in medium 199 supplemented with 20% autochthonous 
   plasma.  Fourteen C.F. homozygotes, seven siblings, and nine parents
   all showed significantly greater uptake (p < 0.001) of 35S-heparin
   than cultures from twenty-three normal controls.  There was partial
   overlap in heparin-uptake values between C.F. patients and their
   families.  This procedure thus differentiates C.F. families from the
   normal population, but does not differentiate C.F. homozygotes from
   heterozygotes.  It is hoped that either variations in culture methods
   or a combination of this procedure with other measurements of C.F.,
   such as ciliary dyskinesis or cellular metachromasia, will permit
   unequivocal identification of C.F. carriers.

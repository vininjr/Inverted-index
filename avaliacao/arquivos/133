EX Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are fats in which the chain length
   is six to twelve carbon atoms.  This is in contrast to the more usual
   dietary sources of fats, long-chain triglycerides (LCT), which
   contain more than 14 carbon atoms in their atomic chain.  The
   differences in chemical structure between LCT and MCT are important
   because they are related to major differences in the characteristics
   of absorption and metabolism of these two classes of lipids.  These
   physiological differences between LCT and MCT have led to the use of
   MCT in various disorders where malabsorption of LCT occurs but where
   MCT can be absorbed because they bypass several of the steps
   necessary for the absorption of long chain fats.  These include
   pancreatic disease, chronic liver disease, disorders of the biliary
   tract and diseases of the small intestinal epithelium and lymphatic
   vessels.  The comments which follow are a brief summary of the
   therapeutic place of MCT in children with malabsorption.  This will
   be followed by some remarks about the potential value of MCT in
   countries like Indonesia where the commonest cause of chronic
   diarrhoea and malabsorption in children is malnutrition and chronic
   and repeated gastrointestinal infections and infestations and where
   MCT has not been used widely.

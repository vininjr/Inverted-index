EX We measured immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) concentrations in 32
   patients with established cystic fibrosis and in 16 parents
   (heterozygotes) of patients with CF.  29 patients (91%) and 6 parents
   (38%) had abnormal trypsin concentrations.  We found that in only 3
   out of the 29 patients with abnormal IRT was the concentration
   supranormal.  Our data suggest that low IRT concentrations are an
   excellent index of diminished pancreatic reserve in CF and that
   serum-IRT concentration would be a useful diagnostic test.  The fact
   that CF patients at birth invariably have very high IRT
   concentrations which fall with age and the progress of the disease,
   allied with the fact that heterozygotes have high concentrations,
   supports the previous suggestion that an uncontrolled hypersecretion
   of zymogen granules is the basic cellular defect in CF.

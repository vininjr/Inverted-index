EX Over the past few years, studies from various laboratories have
   suggested the presence of a factor(s) in cystic fibrosis serum
   causing widespread in vitro abnormalities of components of the lung
   defence mechanism particularly with respect to macrophage
   dysfunction, quantitative and qualitative alterations in mucus, and
   ciliary motility.  The possible in vivo role of ciliary dysfunction
   in the pathogenesis of the disease is of particular clinical
   interest.  Since an in vitro ciliary dyskinesia factor had been
   previously demonstrated and pulmonary complications are the hallmark
   of CF, yet clearance in most of our clinically stable CF subjects was
   relatively well maintained, this suggested to us that a mucociliary
   transport abnormality might be present intermittently.  In order to
   explore this further, we designed nasal mucociliary clearance studies
   to determine whether CF serum might exhibit MCT inhibition in vivo.
   From these studies, we concluded that there was a substance(s) in CF
   serum which had the capacity to slow MCT.  Whether this effect is on
   the cilia themselves or via overproduction of normal or abnormal
   mucus is not known.

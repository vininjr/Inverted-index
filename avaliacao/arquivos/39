EX For Caucasians of European origin, cystic fibrosis (CF) remains the
   commonest recognized autosomal recessive disorder, but it appears to
   be a rarity among the coloured races.  For a time, records may have
   suggested an association between CF and whiteness; in recent years,
   however, instance of CF children have been described whose racial
   origins are Negroid, Mongoloid, and non-European Caucasoid.  The
   present case reports concern 3 Pakistani children born in Birmingham,
   in whom Cf has been confirmed.  2 of the 3 (Cases 1 and 2) were
   brother and sister.  The present incidence of this disease among
   Asian immigrants in the West Midlands is approximately 1:10,000.

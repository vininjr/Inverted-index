AB Filling solution leakage, reproducibility, stability, interferences
   and temperature effects have been studied in relation to the use of
   the Orion 96-17-01 combination chloride ion-selective electrode in
   sweat testing for cystic fibrosis. While stability and
   reproducibility is good, certain antiseptic systems and especially
   Hibitaine (chlorhexidine gluconate) interfere with the electrode and
   therefore need to be absent during sweat testing. Temperature
   conditions during calibration and sweat testing need to be controlled
   in view of the extent of response variations for even modest
   temperature differences between sensor-skin interface and electrode
   stem.

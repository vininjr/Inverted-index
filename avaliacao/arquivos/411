AB Skin fibroblast cultures from an adult population of cystic fibrosis
   (CF) patients have been studied to determine any possible genetic or
   clinical significance of the two classes described for cultured CF
   skin fibroblasts (Danes 1973). On the basis of clinical course, the
   46 adult patients from 43 unrelated families studied were divided
   into two groups (40 typical, 6 atypical). The cultured fibroblasts
   from 37 of the 40 patients with typical CF were Class I
   (metachromatic, cystic fibrosis factor activity (CFFA) in the culture
   medium, and metabolic cooperation with normal fibroblasts), and the
   cultures from the remaining three patients were Class II
   (ametachromatic, no CFFA in the culture medium and no metabolic
   cooperation with metachromatic CF fibroblasts). During the 4-year
   research period one of the 37 patients from Class I and all three
   Class II patients with typical CF succumbed. The cultured skin
   fibroblasts from two of the six patients who had an atypical course
   for CF were Class I and four were Class II. When the parents of three
   of these atypical CF Class II patients were studied, the cultured
   fibroblasts from one parent in each family in each family were Class
   I and the other Class II. The affected offspring from such Class I-II
   matings may represent genetic compounds.

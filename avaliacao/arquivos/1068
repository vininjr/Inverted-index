EX As far as I know, no test for the prenatal diagnosis of cystic
   fibrosis has yet been shown to be reliable, but several experimental
   studies on prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis are being carried
   out.  Deficient protease activity, assayed by 4-methylumbelliferyl
   guanidinobenzoate, an active site titrant of serine proteases, has
   been reported in plasma and cultivated skin fibroblasts from patients
   with cystic fibrosis.  Another prenatal diagnostic test for cystic
   fibrosis involves the observed resistance of patients' skin
   fibroblasts to dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) toxicity,
   in comparison to normal fibroblasts.  Specific induction of alkaline
   phosphatase with Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein, isoproterenol and
   theophylline has been recorded in skin-derived fibroblasts from
   affected patients.

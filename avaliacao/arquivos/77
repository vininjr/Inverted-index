EX The objective of this investigation was to further refine a technique
   developed to serve as a new test procedure for the diagnosis of
   cystic fibrosis of the pancreas utilizing a more quantitative
   approach for measuring, in a standard fashion, the volume of
   secretion of the minor salivary glands of the lower labial mucosa,
   which can be collected over a fixed period of time.  It was also
   hoped that such standardization would facilitate the more accurate
   study of all aspects of study of minor salivary gland secretion
   collected in this fashion.  From the findings, it is obvious that
   less minor salivary gland secretion was collected from cystic
   fibrosis patients than from normal control subjects, using a
   capillary tube test.  This may be due, in part, to an increased
   viscosity of minor-salivary-gland saliva in cystic fibrosis.
   Unfortunately, viscosity studies were beyond the scope of this
   investigation.  The results indicate that the relative differences
   between the volume of minor salivary secretion collected at a
   standard test site and that collected over the total lower labial
   mucosa are similar.  The volumetric differences in minor salivary
   secretion have again been found to be distinctive enough to suggest
   that studies be continued in this area to further refine a diagnostic
   test procedure for cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.  At the present
   time, studies are in progress to measure the volume of minor salivary
   secretion at a standard test site employing an electronic technique.
   It is hoped that this approach may permit the elimination of
   viscosity as a variable.

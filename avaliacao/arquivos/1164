EX In our efforts to standardize the evaluation of bronchial reactivity
   we performed investigations into the threshold dosage of
   acetylcholine-induced bronchospasm in patients with various recurrent
   and chronic bronchopulmonary diseases.  A significantly decreased
   threshold value of acetylcholine and thus an increased bronchial
   reactivity could be proven in patients with cystic fibrosis in
   comparison with healthy children.  The cause of bronchial
   hyperreactivity in patients with CF may be due to proteases deriving
   from leucocytes of the purulent sputum.  Furthermore, we investigated
   the influence of terbutaline on the bronchial obstruction induced by
   acetylcholine in patients with bronchial asthma and cystic fibrosis.
   The groups were comparable, especially with regard to the degree of
   the initial bronchial obstruction.

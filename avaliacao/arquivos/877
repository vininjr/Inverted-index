AB To assess the value of detecting albumin in meconium as a screening
   procedure for cystic fibrosis [CF] 68,000 meconium samples were
   examined by BM Meconium Test, single radial immunodiffusion and
   benzidine reaction. The specificity and sensitivity of this
   combination of tests were 99.67% and 78.57% respectively. The
   prevalence of CF at birth was confirmed as 1:3600 in this country.
   This low prevalence resulted in a relatively high number of false
   positives. Therefore, a positive test result has a low predictive
   value [3.39%] and this is a serious drawback of the method. The
   experiences and opinions of 37 local paediatricians about the
   screening programme were evaluated by a simple questionnaire. Gold's
   decision rule was applied. The least relative cost of
   misclassification justifying a mass-screening programme was 3 times
   higher than the actual relative cost as suggested by the aggregate
   opinion of paediatricians in the region. These results support the
   view that with the methods used screening may have more disadvantages
   than not screening.

AB In II polyps from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, the
   density, shape, and architecture of mucous glands were studied by the
   whole-mount method and compared with 102 non-cystic-fibrosis polyps.
   There were no differences in density which was in most polyps less
   than 0.5 gland/mm.2. The shape and architecture as well as other
   histological appearances of the polyp were also alike in both groups
   of polyps which could not be distinguished. The pathogenesis of nasal
   polyps in cystic fibrosis is discussed. Apparently, it is the same as
   that of non-cystic-fibrosis polyps.

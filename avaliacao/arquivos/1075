AB Using radioimmunoassay, immunoreactive SP (iSP) has been measured in
   the plasma of 162 hospital patients with various disorders and in the
   plasma of 67 pregnant women. In pregnancy, iSP was undetectable in
   40% women as compared to 12% in other hospital patients. The mean iSP
   plasma level in pregnancy was 37.8 +/- 4.6 (SEM) as compared to 77.1
   +/- 4.9 (SEM) pg/ml in other hospital patients. The results support
   earlier observations based on bioassay, suggesting that the blood of
   pregnant women contains higher concentrations of a SP-inactivating
   factor. Of the hospital patients, elevated levels of iSP were found
   in patients with chronic leukaemia, in one patient with a basaloid
   carcinoma of the anus, and in one patient with toxic liver damage and
   pancreatic insufficiency. No correlation was found between thyroid
   function and iSP plasma levels. ISP plasma levels in various
   gastrointestinal disorders were similar to those found in normal
   subjects.

AB Patients with cystic fibrosis have fat malabsorption, providing an
   experimental model for evaluation of the hypothesis that a low-fat
   intake may prevent atherosclerosis. We studied the frequency and
   extent of aortic precursor lesions (fatty streaks, early
   fibromusculoelastic lesions, late fibromusculoelastic lesions) found
   at autopsy in this disease as well as in other patients with
   debilitating disorders but with no apparent impairment of fat
   absorption. Fatty streaks were less common in the cystic fibrosis
   group, as were the late fibromusculoelastic lesions. There was no
   significant difference in the frequency, length, or thickness of the
   early fibromusculoelastic lesions. The findings suggest that fat may
   be responsible for progression but not initiation of the
   fibromusculoelastic precursor lesions, and support the concept that
   early restriction of dietary fat may prevent, delay, or otherwise
   modify atherosclerosis in the adult.

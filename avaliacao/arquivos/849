AB Cystic fibrosis is the most frequent substantially lethal inherited
   disease in the United States. Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis
   has been suggested because early diagnosis permits genetic
   counselling of parents and improved treatment and prognosis for
   cystic fibrosis patients. The fact that cystic fibrosis newborns have
   abnormally high meconium albumin seems to offer the best screening
   approach. Because we have had equivocal and false positive results
   with meconium albumin test strips, we have developed a nephelometric
   automated immunoprecipitation method for the quantitative and
   specific analysis of meconium albumin. On a total of 3895 meconiums
   so far examined, eleven albumin elevations of undetermined origin
   have been detected. Nine of these were associated with prematurity.
   There have been, so far, no detected true positives and no known
   false negatives. The normal range for meconium albumin is in
   agreement with previously published ranges determined using manual
   immunochemical methods. This method is rapid and economic. The
   question of sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of this and
   other detection methods is discussed.

AB The total active transport of Cl ions across the frog's gastric
   mucosa can be considered as: net Cl- flux (serosa to mucosa) = H+ +
   SSC (short-circuit current), all terms expressed as micromole cm-2
   hr-1.  The net chloride flux (Hogben, 1955; Durbin & Heinz, 1958)
   may be divided into two fractions: an acidic one which is equivalent
   to the acid secreted and an electromotive one which accounts for the
   gastric electromotive force.  The changes in SCC can accordingly be
   used as a partial index to the activity of the chloride pump.
   Experiments were designed to investigate the effects of histamine,
   metiamide (H2 receptor antagonist), cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF
   plasma on the above parameters using the frog's isolated gastric
   mucosa.  The SCC and the resistance of the mucosal preparation is
   measured by means of an automatic SCC apparatus (de Jesus, 1977).
   The H ion secretion is measured by pH meter.  Results obtained
   (expressed as mean change (delta) plus or minus S.E. of mean) for
   histamine (10-4 M) (n = 10) show an initial increase of the SCC by
   36.94 plus or minus 2.95 microA cm-2 and a parallel small increase
   in H+ output by 0.045 plus or minus 0.003 micromole cm-2 hr-1.  This
   initial increase in SCC is followed by a drop to a steady-state
   level of 23.62 plus or minus 2.23 microA cm-2 and also by a large
   increase in H+ secretion 2.26 plus or minus 0.22 micromole cm-2
   hr-1.  These results support the work of Rehm (1961) in that
   histamine has an effect first on the Cl- pump and then on the H+
   secretion.  Metiamide (10-4 M) (n = 12) caused a drop in the SCC by
   20.16 plus or minus 2.32 microA cm-2 and also reduced the acid
   secretion by 2.21 plus or minus 0.14 micromole cm-2 hr-1, thus
   suggesting an effect on the Cl- pump as well as on the H+ secretion.
   Significant differences are shown (P < 0.001) between CF and non-CF
   plasma results.  The CF plasma (n = 8) increased the SCC by 17.25
   plus or minus 2.94 microA cm-2 and H+ secretion by 2.38 plus or
   minus 0.43 micromole cm-2 hr-1.  Non-CF plasma caused a slight
   increase in SCC by 5.17 plus or minus 1.1 microA cm-2 and had little
   effect on the H+ secretion, 0.34 plus or minus 0.01 micromole cm-2
   hr-1 (n = 8).  The effect of the CF plasma on the Cl- and H+
   mechanism is of interest since in cystic fibrosis there is an
   abnormal increase of Cl- and Na+ in the sweat of patients (di Sant
   Agnese, Darling, Perera & She, 1953).

AB The levels of gentamicin in blood and in secretions of the
   tracheobronchial tree were measured in 14 children (8 with cystic
   fibrosis and 6 with tracheostomy) in a cross over fashion after the
   administration of 40 mg of gentamicin by aerosol or by endotracheal
   injection. High levels of gentamicin (greater than 20 mug/ml) within
   the bronchial secretions were observed in 7 children after
   aerosolization and in 11 children after endotracheal instillation.
   Corresponding blood levels were low (less than 3 mug/ml) in all
   patients and no detectable levels were found in 10 children after
   aerosolization and in 6 children after endotracheal instillation. No
   significant differences were observed between children with cystic
   fibrosis and those with tracheostomy. Since intramuscular injection
   of gentamicin (a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg) resulted in low levels of
   gentamicin within the bronchial secretions (less than 2 mug/ml in 10
   patients, among whom 4 had undetectable levels); it is concluded that
   the administration of an antibiotic such as gentamicin, directly to
   the trachea by endotracheal injection or by aerosolization might
   prove to be helpful when the infection is confined mainly to the
   tracheo-bronchial tree.

EX Using the technique of 3H-ouabain binding to isolate cells Quissell
   and Pitot concluded that the Na+-K+ ATPase functions normally in
   fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients.  However this finding
   may not be very relevant to the Na+ transport defect occurring in
   this genetic disease.  The Na+ transport abnormality in cystic
   fibrosis seems to be confined to exocrine glands.  It is unknown at
   present whether the defect resides in an active or passive
   transport step of the cation.  At least with isolated sweat gland
   tissue and erythrocytes from cystic fibrosis patients, Na+-K+
   ATPase activity has been found to be normal.  However a decrease in
   the ethacrynic acid-sensitive efflux, a Na+ exchange mechanism, has
   been reported in cystic fibrosis erythrocytes.  These findings
   suggest that there is no fundamental abnormality in the Na+-K+
   ATPase enzyme in the disease, but there may be a defect in an
   ethacrynic acid-sensitive transport step.  Therefore in order to
   obtain a better understanding of the cation transport defect one
   should measure the binding of labelled ethacrynic-acid rather than
   ouabain.

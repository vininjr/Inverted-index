AB The electrical potential difference (PD) across the rectal wall was
   measured in 26 patients with cystic fibrosis of pancreas (CFP) and in
   18 healthy subjects. The PDs obtained in normal children were
   identical to those previously obtained in normal adults. A
   significantly greater dispersion of the values was observed in CFP.
   When the patients were divided into groups according to metachromasia
   in fibroblast cultures, the mean PD was increased only in the
   ametachromatic group. True enough, this observation suggests a
   difference between various forms of CFP, distinguished by
   metachromasia, and thus is a further indication of the heterogeneity
   of the disease. The greater abnormalities in metachromasia negative
   patients may, however, be due solely to the fact that these patients
   are more severely affected by the disease. The urinary excretion of
   tetrahydroaldosterone in patients was within the ranges obtained in
   controls, which excludes the possibility of secondary
   hyperaldosteronism as the source of increased PD. No evidence was
   provided in favour of a basic defect in the intestinal transport of
   Na+ or Cl minus, but K+ concentrations in faecal fluids of patients
   were significantly lower than in controls. The equilibrium
   concentration of K+ could be accounted for by simple passive
   diffusion, suggesting that the epithelium behaved inertly with
   respect to this ion in CFP.

EX This article presents our experience with bronchoscopy as a
   therapeutic and diagnostic tool in the management of patients with
   cystic fibrosis.  The results from therapeutic bronchoscopy and
   bronchial irrigation in cystic fibrosis patients have been quite
   impressive.  Levels of blood gas after the procedure have generally
   shown improvement.  The vital capacity and FEF1 in general have shown
   small but consistent improvements.  The most dramatic effect has been
   the patient's own assessment of the operation.  These patients state
   that their breathing is less labored in that it is less rapid and
   much deeper.  Bronchoscopy offers an effective therapeutic tool in
   the management of pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis.
   Unfortunately, the benefit is short-lived and repeated bronchoscopic
   procedures are often necessary.  It must be accepted that there is a
   point in time when the cardiopulmonary state of a patient's cystic
   fibrosis may have progressed beyond salvageable limits.  It is our
   conviction that earlier bronchoscopy and thorough bronchial
   irrigation may prevent the critical pulmonary event which is followed
   inevitably by progressive deterioration of the pulmonary status of
   patients with cystic fibrosis.

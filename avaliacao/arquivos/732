EX Patients with cystic fibrosis are likely to develop nasal polyps and
   pansinusitis.  This presentation concerns the results of various
   surgical procedures used to treat nasal polyposis in cystic
   fibrosis.  At present recurrent nasal polyposis is still the major
   problem following surgery.  The literature does not deal
   specifically with comparisons of different surgical procedures aimed
   at controlling nasal obstruction or with the surgical management of
   sinus disease in cystic fibrosis patients.  Perhaps this lack
   reflects the unsatisfactory results that would have to be reported,
   since a high recurrence rate is expected.  Also the prolonged
   survival in these children means that more of them are reaching
   adolescence and adulthood with an increasing risk for nasal
   obstruction and nasal polyposis.

EX This review emphasizes some of the positive accomplishments of cystic
   fibrosis research, some of the puzzles and some of the recent
   developments that have promise.  One of the major unresolved
   questions is the maintenance of this lethal gene at such a high
   frequency, perhaps because of a heterozygote advantage in the past,
   no longer operative at present.  Nothing is known of the chromosomal
   localization of the trait; except that chromosomes are
   morphologically normal, that it is autosomal, not sex linked and that
   there is no correlation with blood groups or major HLA loci.  One of
   the important achievements of the past many years is that we
   understand relatively well the pathogenesis of most clinical
   manifestations of CF.  The as yet unknown inherited basic defect or
   metabolic error of CF gives rise to two main anomalies: the
   electrolyte defect in exocrine sweat glands and the 'mucous
   secretion' abnormality.  While the results of tissue culture studies
   often have been conflicting and disparate, it does seem to be the
   consensus that the fibroblasts are affected by the basic metabolic
   error in some manner, and that they respond abnormally under
   different experimental circumstances.  Virtually all investigators
   have found some anomalies in biologic fluids of CF, although using
   different approaches and methods.  An abnormality in the function of
   the autonomic nervous system, which is so closely associated with the
   exocrine glands, has always been an attractive explanation for the
   generalized exocrinopathy of CF.  The search for a genetic animal
   model for CF has led to interesting findings.

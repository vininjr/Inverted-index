AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (173) from 144 patients with cystic
   fibrosis (CF) of the pancreas in seven hospitals were serotyped with
   the agglutination systems of Homma (1974) and Fisher et al. (1969).
   The two systems were complementary. Strains from CF patients were
   much less likely to furnish a stable type on repetitive typing tests
   than strains from other patients. This was related to the frequent
   occurrence of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. The 173 strains were
   divided among 11 Homma serotypes. A single Homma type (type 8)
   capable of mucoid growth comprised 104 (60%) CF strains. Eight
   serotypes were detected in 77 strains from 48 CF patients in one
   hospital; three strains were detected in one hospital CF unit; and
   two strains were detected in each of five hospital CF units. The CF
   serotype comprised from 50 to 93% of CF strains in the seven
   hospitals. These P. aeruginosa strains dissociated in vivo as judged
   by mucoid and nonmucoid colonies on primary culture plates and
   continued to dissociate during subcultures. Both colony type were the
   same serotype. The tendency to regard colonial phenotypes (mucoid,
   nonmucoid, rough) as separate strains was erroneous. Repetitive
   typing with the two systems gave better results than a single system.
   The mucoid P. aeruginosa strain is probably spread from patient to
   patient, rather than acquiring its mucoid characteristic de novo in
   the CF patient. It is not known why the mucoid CF strain has a
   peculiar predilection for CF patients, nor why it generally loses the
   quality in culture but retains it indefinitely in the patient.

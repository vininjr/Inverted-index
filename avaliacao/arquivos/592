EX Treatment of mucus hypersecretion in human disease should first be
   directed at prevention.  The hypersecretion of mucus, even in the
   absence of pus in the sputum or of other signs of infection, is of
   itself associated with significantly poor lung function.  Infection
   is probably the important stimulus in cystic fibrosis.  Certain
   anti-inflammatory agents are now known to cause retention of mucus
   within the secretory cells although the rate of synthesis is not
   raised.  It may be that this offers a new way of control.  On the
   other hand, the cells become larger and this may be undesirable.  I
   would prefer to see a study of the effect of drugs on the cellular
   stages of synthesis and discharge rather than concentration on
   mucolytic agents.

AB The membrane glycoprotein enzyme, alkaline phosphatase was induced in
   cultured human fibroblasts by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, sodium butyrate,
   the serum glycoprotein fetuin, the Tamm-Horsfall urinary
   glycoprotein, and by a number of inhibitors of DNA synthesis. The
   uninduced basal enzyme activity increased at later stages of growth
   when the cells became confluent. Induction by dibutyryl cyclic AMP or
   fetuin was most effective when the agents were added after the cells
   had reached stationary phase and was maximal after at least two days
   of exposure. The levels of induction resulting from the addition of
   pairs of the agents, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, n-butyrate and fetuin were
   additive indicating that these have different modes of action. The
   inhibitors of DNA synthesis, cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea, and
   methothrexate were less effective inducers. Bromodeoxyuridine which
   also has non-DNA mediated effects induced to the same extent as
   dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Similar experiments with sex- and age-matched
   cell strains derived from patients with cystic fibrosis failed to
   detect differences in the levels of induction from those observed in
   normal cells. In addition, the combined inductive effects of Tamm-
   Horsfall glycoprotein, isoproterenol and theophylline, were similar
   with normal and cystic fibrosis cells.

AB In five patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the mucous
   glandular system of the conjunctiva was studied, as changes, if any,
   in the conjunctival goblet cells might be applicable as a diagnostic
   test in questionable cases. A whole-mount technique was used,
   specially developed for studying conjunctival goblet cells. In all
   five cases the qualitative as well as quantitative goblet-cell
   findings were in accordance with a previously reported normal
   material. In particular, there were no signs of stagnated secretion.

EX The author has attempted to summarize the current state of knowledge
   regarding dispositional processes in infants and children of various
   ages.  The traditional processes of absorption, distribution,
   metabolism, and excretion are described not only in newborn infants
   but also in infants and children of other age groups.  Knowledge of
   the effects of age and the effects of diseases, which are often
   unique to each stage of postnatal development, upon drug action and
   disposition is a vital and necessary prerequisite to a discussion of
   interactions of drugs of abuse in the pediatric population.  It is
   essential that the developmental status of the host be taken into
   consideration when examining interactions of drugs in infants and
   children.  The mechanisms of interactions are similar to those seen
   in the adult patient.  The developmental status of the pediatric
   patient also plays a significant role in the manifestations of
   disease seen in sick infants and children.  These are often profound
   and consequently may play a major role in modifying drug action and
   interaction.

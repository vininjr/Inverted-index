AB Admissions to hospital in the Republic of Ireland, in Scotland, and
   in England and Wales for coeliac disease and cystic fibrosis are
   compared.  Admissions to hospital in 1972 for coeliac disease in the
   Republic of Ireland - which does not yet have full returns of
   hospital admissions - was approximately three times greater than the
   number expected based upon the rates in England and Wales in
   1969-71.  In Scotland the admission rates for coeliac disease were
   about twice the expected number based upon the English rates.  This
   contrasted with admissions for cystic fibrosis which were only
   slightly higher in Ireland and in Scotland than in England and
   Wales - evidence that the high admission rates for coeliac disease
   represent a genuinely high rate in the community.  Admission rates
   for coeliac disease were as high in the East and South of Ireland as
   in the West.  In Ireland, the potato, and not the wheaten bread, was
   the staple diet before the great famine of the 1840s.  In
   nineteenth-century Scotland, too, less wheaten bread was eaten than
   in England and Wales.  In the past, therefore, coeliac disease
   would not be as disadvantageous in Ireland, and to a less extent in
   Scotland, as in England and Wales.

AB 46 sweat-samples from 32 children with cystic fibrosis of the
   pancreas (C.F.) and 35 samples from 23 control-children were
   collected with glass micro-capillaries. Protein was determined by
   ultramicro-electrophoresis. Results: 1. Protein was detected in 48%
   of the samples (C.F. and controls). 2. At pH 2.3, C.F.-sweat showed
   at least one more band than control-sweat. 3. At pH 8.9, C.F.-sweat
   occasionally showed one more band than the control-group. 4. At pH
   2.3, more protein was found at the electrophoresis start point using
   C.F.-sweat, whereas at pH 8.9 the opposite was found. 5. At pH 2.3,
   protein was found in fewer samples than at pH 8.9. The "C.F.-factor"
   is postulated to represent a basic polyelectrolyte which induces the
   following pathogenic mechanisms: a) Aggregation of proteins giving
   rise to a high viscosity of secretions, such as saliva. b) Binding to
   the cell-membrane of the glandular epithelium, thus inducing a
   disturbance of active NaCl-reabsorption (e.g. by reduction of luminal
   passive Na+-influx).

AB This study was undertaken because of reports of a marked increase in
   fecal bile acid excretion by children with cystic fibrosis. We
   attempted to confirm this finding by performing [1-14C]cholylglycine
   breath tests and by measuring fecal bile acid and fat excretion in
   patients with cystic fibrosis and acquired pancreatic insufficiency.
   Studies were done when patients were taking pancreatic enzymes
   (Cotazym) and also without medication. 14CO2 excretion in breath was
   normal in patients with acquired pancreatic insufficiency and even
   lower in cystic fibrosis, both with and without Cotazym therapy.
   Fecal bile acid excretion was slightly elevated in both groups
   without Cotazym and became normal with Cotazym in patients with
   acquired pancreatic insufficiency. Steatorrhea was present in both
   patient groups and improved during Cotazym therapy. Bile acid
   malabsorption in cystic fibrosis and acquired pancreatic
   insufficiency is minimal and probably not clinically important.

EX Twelve patients with abdominal complaints had an operation that
   included incidental appendectomy.  They were later diagnosed as
   having cystic fibrosis.  Four groups of presenting signs and symptoms
   were right lower quadrant mass, chronic abdominal pain, intestinal
   obstruction, and hepatomegaly.  In all cases the symptoms
   precipitating operation were due to the underlying unrecognized
   condition: cystic fibrosis.  Review of the histology of the appendix
   revealed the classic changes of hypersecretion of the mucous glands
   to be present.  The appendix shares in the generalized intestinal
   mucous gland involvement peculiar to cystic fibrosis.  Awareness of
   this fact has not been widespread, perhaps because of the usual
   emphasis on the pulmonary and pancreatic aspects of the disease.
   Greater appreciation of the clinical symptoms of cystic fibrosis and
   more liberal use of the sweat test could have diminished the number
   of exploratory celiotomies.  Recognition of the histoloc changes in
   the removed appendices can also suggest the proper diagnosis and lead
   to earlier institution of treatment with an improved prognosis.

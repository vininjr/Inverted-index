EX Turner and associates cited cystic fibrosis as an example of the
   application of the judicious use of genetic counseling and prenatal
   diagnosis.  The reader who is unfamiliar with genetic disorders,
   prenatal diagnosis, and genetic counseling may have taken the "cystic
   fibrosis example" as fact rather than a model, as intended.  Cystic
   fibrosis is a recessive disorder for which prenatal diagnosis and
   heterozygote detection are not yet possible.  Currently, because of
   the present inability to detect the heterozygous state, genetic
   counseling of individuals with a family history of cystic fibrosis
   frequently means a statistical prediction is given, rather than a
   precise recurrence risk.

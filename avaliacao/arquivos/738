AB We have developed a modified rabbit tracheal bioassay for use in
   investigating a possible correlation between cystic fibrosis protein
   (CFP) and ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF) in human serum. The
   bioassay requires high standards of tissue selection, and all
   epithelial tissue must be free of underlying connective tissue. When
   serum samples were collected and processed carefully and warmed to 37
   degrees before assay, CDF could be reliably detected in 31 of 31 sera
   from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes or obligate heterozygotes in 35
   min or less without prior fractionation or concentration of sera,
   whereas 13 of 14 normal control sera were nonreactive. CDF-positive
   serum reacts in three consecutive phases: (1) initial increase in
   ciliary beat frequency, (2) ciliary dyskinesia, and (3) tissue
   destruction with extrusion of single ciliated cells, mucus, and
   debris. Our results confirm the association of CDF with cystic
   fibrosis. The bioassay is not specific for CF, however, when whole
   sera are bioassayed, since serum from several patients with bronchial
   asthma also caused ciliary dyskinesia. However, this finding need not
   preclude using rabbit tracheal ciliated epithelial tissue as an assay
   for following the purification of CDF. Isoelectric focusing showed
   that the presence or absence of CFP corresponded with that of
   dyskinesia activity in all sera tested except for the active samples
   from seven asthma patients, which were negative for CFP. The results
   indicate that CFP and CDF may be identical or closely related markers
   for the CF gene, and suggest that the activity detected by the rabbit
   tracheal bioassay in sera from patients with asthma and other
   diseases probably is caused by a substance different from a CF-
   specific CDF.

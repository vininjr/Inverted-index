EX Cystic fibrosis (CF), like syphilis, could accurately be described as
   "the great imitator."  Many organ systems are involved, and a clear
   understanding of the disease and its many complications is a useful
   exercise in understanding human physiology.  CF could be called
   thick-secretion disease, because all exocrine fluids, like pancreatic
   juice, are thick, or it could be called multimystery disease, because
   there are so many unanswered questions about it.  Many manifestations
   of CF are understandable complications of malabsorption, malnutrition
   and the physical and chemical effects of abnormal exocrine secretion;
   others, including the susceptibility to recurrent nasal polyps, the
   hypersalinized sweat, low female fertility and male sterility, given
   present knowledge, do not make physiologic sense.

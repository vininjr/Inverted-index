AB One hundred fifty-three lung lavage procedures were performed on 81
   cystic fibrosis patients during the years 1963 to 1976. Local
   analgesia was used in 24 lavages done via a rigid bronchoscope and in
   a group of 73 lavages directed by a fiberoptic bronchoscope. No
   abnormalities in cardiac rate or rhythm were observed with the
   lavages directed by fiberoptic bronchoscope. Fifty-six lavages were
   performed under general anesthesia with 20 cardiac abnormalities
   being noted among this group. Subjective improvement was noted in 96%
   of the 56 patients who had lavage under general anesthesia. Objective
   improvement was apparent in 45% of the 24 patients who had lavage
   with the rigid bronchoscope and 64% of the 36 patients who had lavage
   by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. It is concluded that patients with cystic
   fibrosis of varying stages of disability can more safety (and with
   good improvement) have bronchial washouts with the fiber-optic
   bronchoscope than with either of the other two techniques.

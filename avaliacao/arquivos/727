MN ADOLESCENCE.  CASE-REPORT.  HUMAN.  MALE.
AB A 16-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis had intermittent episodes of
   abdominal pain probably due to recurrent intussusceptions.  This
   type of bowel obstruction is probably more frequent in patients with
   fibrocystic disease.  Thick, vascid, inspissated feces appears to be
   the cause of the intussusceptions.  Prevention of the inspissation
   may reduce the incidence of these obstructions.  The treatment for
   this problem is the same as in other (noncystic) patients.

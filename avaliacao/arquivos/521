AB The present study using immunologic methodology confirms previous
   observations from this laboratory of an absence of a protease
   component with arginine esterase activity in plasma of patients with
   cystic fibrosis. In this study, the pooled plasma from control
   individuals was activated and partially purified after adsorption on
   columns of soybean trypsin inhibitor conjugated to Sepharose 4B
   followed by elution with benzamidine. The fraction was further
   purified by isoelectrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels. Proteins
   around the pI range of 5.5 were eluted and utilized to prepare an
   antiserum. Immunoelectrophoresis of activated plasma samples from
   control subjects and patients with cystic fibrosis was performed
   utilizing the antiserum. In controls, four precipitin arcs with
   residual esterase activity were observed, whereas only three were
   seen in plasma from patients with cystic fibrosis. Double gel
   diffusion experiments using specific antisera ruled out the presence
   of trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasminogen, prothrombin, C1 esterase,
   alpha one-trypsin inhibitor, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor in the
   concentrated benzamidine eluate. The antisera to alpha two-
   macroglobulin gave an immunoprecipitate which was readily stained for
   proteolytic activity. On immunoelectrophoresis, the alpha two-
   macroglobulin precipitin band corresponded to the band absent in
   plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis. In contrast, the alpha two-
   macroglobulin levels were similar in plasma of control subjects and
   patients with cystic fibrosis. Using the antiserum to the protein
   fractith proteolytic activity could be demonstrated in control
   plasma. One specific enzyme-active "rocket" was absent in plasma of
   patients with cystic fibrosis. In a double blind study of 15 control
   samples and 15 samples from patients with cystic fibrosis, a specific
   "rocket" was shown to be present in 13 control samples and absent in
   14 cystic fibrosis samples. alpha two-Macroglobulin was determined by
   both an immunologic procedure and by its trypsin binding (trypsin
   protein esterase concentration). The ratio of the immunologic assay
   to the biologic activity assay was 90 for the normal plasma samples
   and only 65 for cystic fibrosis samples.

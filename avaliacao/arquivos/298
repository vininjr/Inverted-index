EX Diarrhoea can be defined as the passage of loose stools and increased
   bowel frequency above the accepted norm for the individual and
   resulting in excess loss of water and electrolytes in the faeces.  It
   may or may not be associated with steatorrhea (fatty stools).
   History plays a vital part in the diagnosis of gastro-intestinal
   disease in children.  Time spent here is often more rewarding than a
   battery of specialised investigations.  One must be clear what the
   parent means by diarrhoea, as terminology among doctors, nurses, and
   parents is often confusing.  When dealing with children one must
   always adopt a comprehensive approach and consider the whole child
   and his family.  Common causes, mechanisms, and consequences are
   discussed.  Some of the common causes of diarrhoea are cystic
   fibrosis, gluten-induced enteropathy (coeliac disease), Giardia
   lamblia, sugar intolerance, gastro-intestinal allergy, and irritable
   bowel syndrome.

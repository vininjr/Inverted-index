AB Pulmonary function in children with cystic fibrosis was assessed by
   the arterial-alveolar PN2 difference adjusted to sublingual
   temperature. The resulting values were compared with the alveolar-
   arterial PO2 difference, arterial PCO2, and standard measurements of
   lung volume, flow, and diffusing capacity. The arterial-alveolar PN2
   difference was nearly one half of the PO2 difference, both early in
   the disease and at a more advanced stage. Analysis taking into
   account the O2 dissociation curve and the possibility that alveolar
   temperature is higher than sublingual temperature suggested that all
   of the PO2 difference could be explained in terms of ventilation-
   perfusion imbalance in gas-filled units of the lung. Reduction of
   fractional CO uptake with increasing PN2 difference suggested that
   the decrease in diffusing capacity in cystic fibrosis may be
   explained by ventilation-perfusion inequality. A significant
   relationship between arterial PCO2 and the PN2 difference supported
   the view that ventilation-perfusion inequality is the cause of CO2
   retention when present. The PN2 and PO2 differences were abnormal
   before the standard tests of lung volume and flow, but in general,
   the correlation was excellent. Because the PN2 difference was not
   superior to the PO2 difference in detecting early disease, and
   because the technical problems in its measurement are considerable,
   it is not recommended as a routine measurement.

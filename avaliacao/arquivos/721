AB Currently employed methods for the assay of electrolytes in sweat,
   relevant to the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, are critically
   evaluated with particular reference to the measurement of electrical
   conductivity. Attention is drawn to the factors responsible for
   potentially large errors. On the basis of experimentation, supported
   by laboratory practice, recommendations are made for the reduction of
   these errors to clinically acceptable levels. Data concerning sodium
   and potassium content, electrical conductivity and osmolality of
   undiluted sweat collections are compared. The feasibility and
   comparative advantages of measuring sweat osmolality with a vapour
   pressure osmometer are discussed.

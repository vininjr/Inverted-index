AB The effects of an artificial diet on growth were examined in a
   controlled trial on 43 patients with cystic fibrosis. 28 patients
   received the diet for 12 months. Comparison was made between their
   growth before, during, and after dietary treatment. Growth changes
   were also assessed in 15 other patients who received a conventional
   diet. Artificial dietary treatment led to some improvement in height,
   weight, subscapular skinfold thickness, and a disproportionate
   advance of bone age for the group as a whole. Only 10 (36%) patients
   had a 'clinically' significant improvement in height, weight, or both-
   -i.e. more than 0.5 standard deviation score. Greatest improvements
   were in young and mildly affected patients. It is proposed that the
   future use of such an unpleasant and expensive diet should be
   restricted to a few selected cases, rather than given as routine
   treatment.

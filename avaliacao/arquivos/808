EX An adult male was recently discovered to have cystic fibrosis after a
   unique clinical presentation not mentioned in the review article.
   This patient with recurrent episodes of heat exhaustion and
   hyponatremia had no extraordinary source of Na+ loss other than his
   sweat.  This case represents an important new presentation of cystic
   fibrosis.  Most internists view this disease as one seen only in
   chronically ill children.

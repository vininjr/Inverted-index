AB Elasticity of sputum.  Elasticity of sputum has been determined
   using the Weissenberg rheogoniometer, by oscillatory testing, over
   frequencies from 0.01 to 0.8 c/s.  Sputum was from patients with
   either asthma, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or
   bronchiectasis and, macroscopically, mucoid, mucopurulent or
   purulent.  As in the viscosity plot over this shear rate range two
   Zones with a junctional region can be distinguished.  In Zone 1,
   over the lowest shear rates, elasticity increases slowly, changes
   little over a "plateau" region and then, in Zone 2, increases
   sharply.  In contrast to the viscosity plot, the plateau does not
   show nothing.  By 0.8 c/s some samples show decreasing elasticity.
   Although variance between samples is wide, there is no level of
   elasticity characteristic of each disease or of one macroscopic
   appearance.  Elasticity and viscosity are correlated, most
   significantly at the lowest shear rates.  Asthmatic and
   bronchiectatic sputa resemble each other in that this correlation
   is still significant at higher shear rates, cystic fibrosis and
   chronic bronchitic sputum in that it is not.  Since in these last
   two mucous gland hypertrophy is present, it may be that the sputum
   has a higher mucus component.

AB Serum proteins have been studied by means of paper electrophoresis
   in 88 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and correlated with
   bacteriological lung findings.  An increase of all serum globulin
   fractions in CF patients was found, whereas albumin and
   albumin/globulin ratio were decreased.  The changes in all serum
   protein fractions were significantly greater in patients with
   constant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the lungs than in
   patients without this constant infection (p < 0.005), whereas
   patients with intermittent pseudomonas infection did not have more
   severe changes than patients without pseudomonas infection.  The
   changes in gamma-globulin and total globulin were significantly
   greater in patients with frequent Staphylococcus aureus infections
   than in patients with rare Staphylococcus aureus infections (p <
   0.005 and p < 0.05, respectively).  As regards the other serum
   protein fractions, no significant differences between patients with
   frequent and rare staphylococcus infections were found.  Judged by
   simple scoring systems, the lung disease of patients with constant
   pseudomonas infection was significantly more progressed clinically
   and radiologically than that of patients without constant
   pseudomonas infection (p < 0.00005), whereas no significant
   differences were found between the other patient groups.

EX An alternative method for assaying the cystic fibrosis factor could
   be on the electrophysiological responses of isolated living tissues.
   The ability of the frog's gastric mucosa to secrete hydrochloric acid
   and maintain a negative potential difference is well known.  This
   potential difference across the secretory (mucosa) to the nutrient
   (serosa) side coupled with its property of transporting chloride and
   hydrogen ions against an electrochemical gradient could therefore
   serve as a useful model for investigating any induced changes in the
   presence of CF and non-CF plasma.  From the results obtained the
   short circuit current and H+ secretion responses in the presence of
   CF (whole) plasma show significant increases compared to the control.
   These findings show that in the presence of CF plasma, whole or
   plasma fraction B, there is a marked increase in the actively
   transported Cl- and H+.  The effect of CF plasma in increasing net
   Cl- flux is important considering the elevation of this electrolyte
   in the sweat of CF patients and deserved further investigation.

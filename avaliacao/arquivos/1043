AB In this echocardiographic study, assessment of the heart in children
   with cystic fibrosis has shown that changes occur in not only the
   right ventricle but also in the left ventricle and aorta, as compared
   with normal. Echocardiograms could be successfully performed in 34 of
   37 patients. The thickness of the right ventricular anterior wall and
   the dimension of the right ventricular cavity  were abnormal, even in
   patients with mild disease (National Institutes of Health [NIH] score
   for severity of disease of 85 or greater). Larger, older children
   with lower NIH score had disproportionately larger right ventricular
   anterior walls and cavities. The thickness of the septal wall, the
   thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall, and the aortic
   dimensions were increased in those with severe disease. The
   dimensions of the left ventricular cavity for the population were
   slightly but significantly smaller than normal in systole and in
   diastole throughout the course of the disease. This study
   demonstrates that echocardiography is an effective noninvasive means
   of assessing the long-term changes in children with cystic fibrosis.
   These changes occur in both sides of the heart and appear to worsen
   as the disease progresses.

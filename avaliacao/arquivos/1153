EX In 1977, we demonstrated the efficiency of autogenic drainage with
   two bronchorrheic children, who needed bronchography for diagnostic
   purposes.  This demonstration was made possible thanks to a
   radiocinematographic study after bronchography.  The examination also
   showed the inefficacy of coughing.  The object of the present study
   is to analyze the physiologic mechanism of autogenic drainage.  For
   children older than five, this method is very simple and efficient
   and as the effort or onset is not excessive and as expiration does
   not need to be complete, autogenic drainage is not exhausting and can
   be performed for a long time, which is indispensable since the
   progression of secretions is slow.

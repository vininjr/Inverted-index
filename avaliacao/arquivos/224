AB Conventional means to facilitate clearance of inspissated material
   obstructing gas exchange in the alveoli and finer airways of
   patients with alveolar proteinosis, asthma, and mucoviscidosis, are
   often not very effective.  The mechanical removal of such materials
   by volume controlled unilateral lung lavage with saline has been of
   benefit in selected patients refractory to conventional therapy
   (particularly those with alveolar proteinosis or accidentally
   inhaled radioactive particles).  This report describes the
   anaesthetic and lavage techniques currently used in managing
   patients with alveolar proteinosis and mucoviscidosis and in whom
   lung lavage repeated at approximately six-month intervals has
   resulted in both subjective and objective improvements.  In 14
   lavages in four different patients (10 lavages in two patients with
   alveolar proteinosis and four lavages in two patients with
   mucoviscidosis) certain physiologic responses to lung lavage,
   particularly those related to oxygen transport, were measured
   quantitatively in an attempt to evaluate and to optimize anaesthetic
   and lavage techniques.  The maintenance anaesthetic during lavage
   was selected randomly, so that each patient received light
   anaesthesia with ketamine/diazepam during one lavage and light
   halothane anaesthesia during lavage of the contralateral lung.

AB The nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia salina are dependent upon the
   function of their salt gland to maintain osmotic pressure within
   narrow limits. A number of drugs interfere with this function and are
   lethal to the nauplii. Saliva and serum from normal persons, patients
   with cystic fibrosis, and obligate heterozygotes were tested for
   lethal effect against brine shrimp nauplii. At salt concentrations
   between 100 mM and 2.5 no difference was found among the phenotypes.
   At lower concentrations a difference was noted occasionally between
   some normal subjects and some individuals carrying one or two genes
   for cystic fibrosis. Data from an independent series of experiments
   indicate that the naupliar deaths result from distorted ratios of
   Na+/K+ and not from a specific gene product. No difference was noted
   in the O2 uptake of nauplii treated with saliva or serum obtained
   from normal subjects, patients with cystic fibrosis, or obligate
   heterozygotes.

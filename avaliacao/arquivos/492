EX The Boehringer Mannheim test meconium strip advertised for detection
   of cystic fibrosis was, like many other diagnostic aids, marketed
   before its reliability was proven.  The test is positive in many
   infants who do not have cystic fibrosis, and may be negative in those
   who have the disease.  It is therefore unacceptable for routine
   screening of newborn infants for cystic fibrosis.

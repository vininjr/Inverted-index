AB The single envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus was
   used as a specific probe of glycosyltransferase activities in
   fibroblasts from two cystic fibrosis patients, an obligate
   heterozygous carrier and a normal individual. Gel filtration of
   pronase-digested glycopeptides from both purified virions and
   infected cell-associated VSV glycoprotein which had been labeled
   with[3H] glucosamine did not reveal any significant differences in
   the glycosylation patterns between the different cell cultures. All 4
   cell lines were apparently able to synthesize the mannose- and
   glucosamine- containing core structure and branch chains terminating
   in sialic acid which are characteristic of asparagine-linked
   carbohydrate side chains in cellular glycoproteins. Analysis of
   tryptic glycopeptides by anion-exchange chromotography indicated that
   the same 2 major sites on the virus polypeptide were recognized and
   glycosylated in all 4 VSV-infected cell cultures. These studies
   suggest that the basic biochemical defect(s) in cystic fibrosis is
   not an absence or deficiency in enzymes responsible for the
   biosynthesis of complex carbohydrate side chains.

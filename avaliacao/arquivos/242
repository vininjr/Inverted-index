EX Lung function tests were conducted in 35 patients with cystic
   fibrosis and correlated to class of skin fibroblast metachromasia.
   Seven patients belonged to class I (vesticular metachromasia), 16 to
   class II (generalized metachromasia), and 12 to class III (no
   metachromasia).  Class I patients had significantly lower vital
   capacity (VC) than class II patients.  As regards the other lung
   function tests, no general trends were found in class I patients
   compared with the other two classes.  For class III patients the lung
   function tests reflected more serious lung changes than those of
   class II patients; statistically significant differences were found
   as regards residual volume/total lung capacity, one-second forced
   expiratory volume (FEV1), and FEV1/VC.  The differences were not due
   to varying intensity of treatment.  The results are in accordance
   with the findings in a previous study of the clinical and
   radiological lung symptoms and serum protein values in CF when
   correlated to metachromatic classes.

AB Secondary cystathioninuria was found in two of 46 children suffering
   from tumors, leukemia, liver disease, inherited metabolic disorders,
   cystic fibrosis and celiac disease. Of these two patients, one had
   congenital biliary atresia and the other cytomegalovirus infection.
   Seven further children had only moderately elevated excretion of
   cystathionine. It is suggested that secondary cystathioninuria is
   uncommon in the disease investigated.

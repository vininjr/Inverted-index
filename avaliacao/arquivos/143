AB A comprehensive study of tRNA and 18 S and 28 S rRNA methylation in
   human fibroblasts is presented.  Cells from normal volunteers and
   patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were examined during exponential
   growth by incubation with L-(methyl-14C)methionine and (3H)uridine.
   The ratio of 14C to 3H counts per minute in isolated RNA serves as a
   measure of the extent of methylation and was found to be similar in
   normal and CF fibroblasts for tRNA, 18 S rRNA, and 28 S rRNA.
   Hydrolyzed samples of (14C)-methyl-labeled RNA species were analyzed
   by two dimensional chromatography and autoradiography.  The
   methylated base and nucleoside compositions of tRNA and rRNA agree
   well with data for HeLa cells and other eurkaryote cells such as
   those from yeast, mouse, and chicken.  RNA methylation patterns in
   CF fibroblasts were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to
   those observed in normal cells for 4 S, 18 S, and 28 S RNA.  There
   is no evidence that RNA species from patients with cystic fibrosis
   are deficient in any methylated components.  Methylation of RNA by
   tissue-cultured cells from cystic fibrosis is qualitatively and
   quantitatively normal and will not prove to be a useful marker for
   identification of carriers of cystic fibrosis.

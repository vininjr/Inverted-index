AB Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of nail clippings
   was used in the development of a diagnostic method for cystic
   fibrosis (CF).  From CF patients and controls more than three years
   old, nail clippings were sampled for tests of different errors.  As
   a result of this study a precise collection routine was outlined.
   Sodium is easily washed out from nail clippings.  The risk of sodium
   contamination of the nails seems to be small.  The sodium
   distribution in the nail is inhomogeneous, and the sodium content
   varies also from nail to nail in the same person.  There is good
   evidence that the increased sodium in the nails of CF patients comes
   from the sweat.  There seems to be a basic "intrinsic" sodium level,
   which is about the same in the nails of CF patients as in controls.
   The precision and accuracy of INAA for determining sodium in nails
   is considered satisfactory.  It is concluded that INAA of the sodium
   concentration in nail clippings is a suitable method as an aid in
   the diagnosis of CF if a precise collection routine is used.

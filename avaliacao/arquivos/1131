EX Our cystic-fibrosis  children usually either have severe lung disease
   with mild steatorrhea or severe maldigestion with lesser pulmonary
   problems.  We therefore measured serum-proteases in cystic-fibrosis
   patients and controls to see if there was any support for the
   following hypothesis: since lack of antitrypsin is associated with
   lung damage, plasma-trypsin in excess of antitrypsin might be
   responsible for the lung damage in cystic fibrosis.  General protease
   and trypsin levels were measured spectrophotometrically using a
   modification of the method of Erlanger, Kojowsky and Cohen.  Our
   result showed no significant difference between protease and trypsin
   levels in cystic-fibrosis patients and controls.  The difference
   between our results and those of Crossley et al. may be explained by
   the differing measuring technique used.  Our trypsin levels were
   measured spectrophotometrically and theirs by radioimmunoassay.

AB In 21 children with cystic fibrosis, the vectorcardiogram (VCG) was
   correlated with various indices of the severity of the disease. The
   best correlation was found between (1) the azimuth angle of the
   spatial QRS loop area, representing the rightward and posterior shift
   of the main electrical forces, and pulmonary function tests (PFT):
   FEV1 % predicted (r = -0.671, P less than 0.005) and VC% predicted (r
   = -0.607, P less than 0.005), and (2) the right ventricular anterior
   wall index measured echocardiographically (r = 0.472, P less than
   0.05). More VCG parameters correlated significantly with PFT than
   with the echocardiogram. This shows the major influence of pulmonary
   changes on the VCG of those patients. In several subgroups with
   different clinical scores, the VCG were analyzed and compared to
   normal limits of age- and sex-matched controls. In this small series,
   the VCG was a specific but not very sensitive method for predicting
   the degree of severity of the disease. Echocardiography and
   vectorcardiography can be considered as two complementary techniques
   in the evaluation of cystic fibrosis.

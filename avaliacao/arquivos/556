EX It was decided to treat all seventeen cystic fibrosis patients under
   our care who were known to have active infection with mucoid strains
   of Pseudomonas, using large intravenous doses of tobramycin.  By the
   objective observations made, results were not so satisfactory.
   Changes in white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
   seemed often to conflict with clinical impression of improvement.
   However, there was closer agreement between subjective judgements,
   weight gain and respiratory function changes.  Eradication of
   Pseudomonas from the sputum was achieved in four cases, although the
   duration of follow-up in one was very short.

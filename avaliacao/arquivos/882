EX Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease affecting mainly Caucasians.
   All exocrine glands are obstructed, causing multiple manifestations.
   The most lethal aspect is the pulmonary involvement.  Early diagnosis
   and treatment influence prognosis.  The sweat test is the diagnostic
   tool; it must be done in a center where it is performed frequently
   and where quality control is available.  Specific therapy varies from
   center to center, but all agree on a consistent, comprehensive
   approach to management.  One must be acutely aware of the
   psychosocial aspects when caring for children with cystic fibrosis.

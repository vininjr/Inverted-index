EX Wilson et al. reported a biophysical assay for cystic fibrosis that
   employed isoelectric focusing of serum proteins.  Their work appeared
   to establish the presence of a definitive marker for CF serum in the
   form of a protein band that was not present in normal serum.  We
   tried to repeat their work and found that the background color of the
   fresh electropherograms made it rather difficult to detect
   unequivocally the presence or absence of bands in the appropriate pH
   region in CF vs. control serum.  However, when the gels were
   photographed using Kodak Panatomic X film and a Wratten 25 A red
   filter, the color response and contrast of the film eliminated this
   interference to a great extent and it was much easier to detect the
   putative band.  We agree partially with the observations of Wilson
   and Fudenberg, but would like to stress that the technique is not a
   diagnostic test.

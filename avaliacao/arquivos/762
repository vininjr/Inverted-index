EX The three patients described here have all been seen recently at the
   Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and each has
   presented a diagnostic problem.  In the three cases presented it has
   been difficult to establish the true diagnosis.  In the first case,
   symptoms compatible with the diagnostic criteria of Beumont and his
   colleagues were directly the result of a slow-growing cerebral
   neoplasm which was elusive to diagnose.  The second patient, a boy
   with cystic fibrosis, showed symptoms strongly suggestive of
   anorexia nervosa and responded to dietary measures without
   pancreatic enzyme replacement.  We have been unable to demonstrate
   any organic disease in the third case and, hence, a presumptive
   diagnosis of anorexia nervosa has been made.  It remains to be said
   that this condition is extremely rare in boys and that anorexia with
   weight loss warrants extremely thorough investigation.

AB Two patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who subsequently developed
   celiac disease (CD) are described. Since organ culture of intestinal
   mucosa has been used to establish an in vitro model for the study of
   CD, we utilized this opportunity to determine whether duodenal mucosa
   obtained from each of these two patients and their immediate families
   differed in its organ culture behavior from mucosa obtained from
   patients with CD alone. Additionally, as specific HL-A types are
   associated with CD, we used HL-A typing to determine whether the two
   patients with CF-CD differed genetically from patients with CD alone.
   One of our patients was HL-A8, the most common type associated with
   CD; the other was HL-A12, as are many of the non-HL-A8 celiac
   patients. The response in organ culture of the mucosa of these two
   patients was the same as the response in organ culture of the mucosa
   from patients with CD alone. These and other data suggest that CD
   occurring in patients with CF is no different than CD occurring
   alone.

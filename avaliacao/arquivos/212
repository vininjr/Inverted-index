EX Twelve patients with cystic fibrosis were started on an artificial
   diet of Albumaid and Caloreen, together with a supplement of medium
   chain triglyceride oil, vitamins, and minerals.  Growth velocity and
   general health were assessed over a period of a full year for each
   child.  Patients who were only mildly affected by the disease showed
   improvement in stool frequency and growth rate when the diet
   represented the major part of their nutritional intake.  Patients who
   were severely affected showed no improvement in growth, general
   clinical status, or frequency of respiratory infections.

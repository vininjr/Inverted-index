EX Cystic fibrosis is an inborn disease which affects chiefly the lungs
   and the digestive system.  Today cystic fibrosis is known to be one
   of the commonest genetic disorders affecting children in Britain.
   The children who actually develop cystic fibrosis have inherited the
   disease from both parents, who are carriers but are unaffected by the
   disease themselves.  Being thick and sticky, instead of thin and
   slimy as it normally is, the mucus of the cystic fibrosis case tends
   to block the passages instead of clearing them.  The main problem is
   in the lungs.  Symptoms, diagnosis, care of nutrition, prevention of
   infection, respiratory education, and future research are discussed.

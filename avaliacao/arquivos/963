AB To evaluate the long-term effect of nocturnal mist tent therapy on
   the progression of airway obstruction in children with cystic
   fibrosis (CF) of varying severity, two matched groups each consisting
   of 24 children with CF were studied during 18 months on mist tent
   therapy and 18 months of therapy. The progression in airway
   obstruction was measured by change in serial measurements of maximal
   midexpiratory flow (MMEF), from which a regression equation of MMEF
   against time was obtained for each individual. Changes in MMEF value
   with or without therapy were compared in patients matched for
   severity of disease as indicated by initial MMEF values. For the
   group as a whole no differences were found in the progression of the
   airway obstruction whether the patients received mist tent therapy or
   not. This therapy failed to benefit any of the groups of children
   with CF who had early, moderate, or advanced airway obstruction as
   judged from their initial MMEF value. It is concluded that nocturnal
   mist tent therapy neither decreases airway obstruction nor prevents
   its progression in children with CF.

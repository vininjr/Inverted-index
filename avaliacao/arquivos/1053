AB Secretion of the lysosomal enzyme beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC
   3.2.1.30) by normal and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts has been
   compared. In contrast to an earlier report, no differences were found
   in either the rate of secretion, or in the molecular forms of the
   enzyme secreted by normal fibroblast cultures and cultures initiated
   from patients with cystic fibrosis. The B isoenzyme of beta-N-
   acetylglucosaminidase from cystic fibrosis fibroblasts was converted
   to a more negatively charged form during preincubation for 3 h at pH
   5.0 and 37 degrees C. The enzyme from normal fibroblasts was
   unaffected by this treatment.

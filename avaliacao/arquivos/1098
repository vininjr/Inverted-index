EX A 5-month-old white girl was admitted to an Infant Intensive Care
   Unit of Jackson Memorial Hospital.  According to her mother, the baby
   had been in "her usual state of health" until one week before
   admission, when she began to "spit up" after feedings and her lower
   extremities became puffy.  Vomiting increased in frequency until it
   occurred after every meal; eventually the baby refused all feedings;
   there was no diarrhea.  Ultimately, the family's physician, when
   consulted, recommended that she be admitted to the hospital.  On the
   fourth day she developed renal failure with anuria and rising
   creatinine concentration despite adequate fluid intake; peritoneal
   dialysis was begun.  However, she soon became hypothermic and
   developed pulmonary edema, and she died a few hours later.  A
   discussion of the case is presented.

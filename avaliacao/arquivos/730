EX Preliminary nitrogen balance trials have been carried out with six
   patients known to have pancreatic insufficiency to investigate the
   utilisation of protein from a general diet; protein from a general
   diet plus exogenous pancreatic extract; and pre-digested protein,
   comprising 85% of dietary nitrogen intake, in the absence of a
   pancreatic supplement.  In all cases, the addition of pancreatic
   supplement to the general diet improved protein digestibility and
   utilisation.  Substituting 85% of the dietary protein with the
   enzymic casein hydrolysate resulted in further improvement in
   nitrogen balance (but not digestibility) for five of the patients.
   Urinary nitrogen levels of the casein hydrolysate diet tended to be
   lower, which accounts for the finding above.  With the
   acid-hydrolysed protein, urinary nitrogen was higher when compared
   with the excretion from the partial casein hydrolysate and provided
   smaller positive nitrogen balances.  These preliminary findings
   indicate that, for some patients with pancreatic insufficiency,
   partial hydrolysates have greater potential for nitrogen retention
   than the administration of exogenous pancreatic extracts with intact
   protein.  It is suggested that a daily supplement of pre-digested
   protein might be advantageous for CH children to ensure that minimum
   protein requirements are met.

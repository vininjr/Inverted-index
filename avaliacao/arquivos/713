EX I have found that cystic fibrosis (C.F.), which is very common in
   South West Africa, occurs almost exclusively in white Afrikaners,
   probably as a result of inbreeding, the drift from the Northern Cape
   Colony, and religious and geographical separation.  However, I have
   not found C.F. in the descendants of the Angola Boers, a small
   proportion (6 - 7%) of the White population who belong to a small
   branch of the Dutch Reformed Church.  The absence of C.F. may stem
   from their limited numbers (7000) but I suggest that it may have at
   least partially a genetic basis.  Homozygotes with C.F. are subject
   to salt-losing crises which can be fatal in hot weather and
   heterozygotes often have an increased concentration of sodium and
   chlorine ions in their sweat.  The influence of environmental
   temperature and drought may explain why C.F. occurs among Blacks in
   temperate zones of the United States but not in Africa, and is less
   frequent in the hot southern regions of Europe than in the colder,
   more northern areas.  Negative selection of this type may have
   operated only in hot, arid environments and the possibility that
   other environments offered advantages to C.F. heterozygotes cannot be
   excluded.

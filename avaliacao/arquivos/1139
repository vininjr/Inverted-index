EX Dr Hosli and Esther Vogt base their diagnosis of heterozygotes and
   homozygotes for cystic fibrosis on the thermal stability in plasma or
   extracellular fluids of alpha-mannosidase and/or phosphatase activity
   assayed at pH 5.4.  The activity of alpha-mannosidase in plasma and
   this pH is a composite one: both acidic alpha-mannosidase, which has
   a pH optimum of 4.25 and intermediate alpha-mannosidase, which has a
   pH optimum of 5.6 - 6.0, will contribute to the activity measured at
   pH 5.4.  These two forms of alpha-mannosidase are structurally and
   genetically distinct and have different kinetics and
   thermostabilities.  Therefore the total alpha-mannosidase activity at
   pH 5.4 and the physicochemical properties of this activity will
   depend upon the relative proportions of the two types of
   alpha-mannosidase in the sample.  The proportions of the two forms
   vary widely in normal plasma, especially in plasma from children.
   Although the data of Hosli and Vogt suggest that the total
   alpha-mannosidase at pH 5.4 does not differ significantly between
   controls, CF heterozygotes and CF homozygotes, they do not show
   whether the proportions of acidic and intermediate alpha-mannosidase
   have changed.  An increase in the proportion of the thermolabile
   intermediate alpha-mannosidase in CF would be manifested as a
   decreased thermostability of alpha-mannosidase at pH 5.4.
   Alternatively a mutation in the normally stable acidic
   alpha-mannosidase leading to a less stable form would also be
   reflected as a decreased stability in the activity at pH 5.4,
   especially if the proportion of acidic alpha-mannosidase was
   increased in CF.  These situations should also be considered as
   possible explanations of the observations, in addition to the one
   favoured by Hosli and Vogt.

AB Lipids from the sputum of patients with asthma and with cystic
   fibrosis were isolated and characterized. In both cases, lipids
   constituted approximately 30% of the dry material.
   Phosphatidlycholine was the most abundant lipid, Significant amounts
   of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were present.
   Hexosyl ceramides, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol,
   lysophosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine were
   present as minor lipid components. Apperciable quantities of neutral
   lipids were present, of which triglycerides and cholesterol were the
   main constituents. Phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and
   phosphatidylgycerol were highly saturated. Large amounts of
   phosphatidylcholine containing mostly palmitic acid, particularly in
   the asthmatic sputum, suggest htat this highly saturated. Large
   amounts of phosphatidylcholine containing mostly palmitic acid,
   particularly in the asthmatic sputum, suggests that this highly
   saturated phospholipid is synthesized in the upper airways for
   reasons other than its beneficial surface-active properties in the
   alveoli.

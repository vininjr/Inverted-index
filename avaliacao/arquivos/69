AB It is estimated that cystic fibrosis affects approximately one of
   every 2,000 white children born in the United States, and is now
   generally regarded as the commonest serious metabolic disorder of
   white children with the exception of diabetes mellitus.  Its
   occurrence in children of Afro-Americans is quite rare and
   exceedingly so in those of Oriental extraction.  Since cystic
   fibrosis is genetically determined as an autosomal recessive trait,
   and since the obligate heterozygote parent is entirely asymptomatic,
   the disease on its first occurrence in a given family can only be
   suspected by its manifestations in the patient himself.  At present
   there is no test available for the detection of cystic fibrosis
   which can be applied as a simple, practical screening test, such as
   is available for phenylketonuria.  Diagnostic tests are, therefore,
   used to confirm or refute the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis when
   suggestive symptoms arise or when a sibling or relative is known to
   have the disease.

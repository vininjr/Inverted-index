AB Assessment of intelligence by the "draw-a-man" test and school
   reports has shown that, despite severe early malnutrition in children
   who had neonatal resection of ileum, the frequency of mental
   retardation is no higher than in the normal population.  The scores
   in patients with cystic fibrosis were also similar to the control
   group.

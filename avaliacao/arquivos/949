EX It has been almost 5 years since the publication of our original
   report describing a "cystic fibrosis factor" (now designated "cystic
   fibrosis protein" or CFP) detected in the serum of most homozygotes
   and heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis when analyzed using isoelectric
   focusing in thin layer polyacrylamide gels.  The recent report by
   Scholey et al. confirms that CFP is present in the majority of CF
   sera and that it can be detected by our methods.  Before discussing
   whether the CFP can be used as a diagnostic marker for cystic
   fibrosis, we would like to examine more closely some of the
   requirements of the method which seemed to have been critical for the
   detection of CFP by Scholey et al.  We would like to point out that
   Scholey and his coworkers adhered closely to most of our guidelines
   during their attempts to detect CFP.  The exact nature of CFP and the
   other ciliary dyskinesia factors is only partially known, and all
   aspects of their metabolism are not yet understood.  Therefore, it
   may be some time before we comprehend the incomplete concordance
   found between CFP and the pathogenesis of CF.

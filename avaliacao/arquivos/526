AB Parotid saliva was collected from 22 children with cystic fibrosis
   (CF) and 21 control children. Stimulation was by 0.1 ml 5% citric
   acid on the tongue every 15 sec over a period of 10 min, and samples
   were collected for 2-min intervals. Stimulated saliva showed a lag
   period of low amylase release, and an activated period of higher
   amylase release. The major difference between CF and child control
   parotid saliva was in the elevated calcium concentrations in CF
   subjects. Flow rate and amylase, although higher in the CF group,
   were not raised to a statistically significant level. There were
   higher mean values for sodium and inorganic phosphate in CF children
   but statistical significance was minimal. Potassium values were
   almost identical in CF and control saliva. In the activated parotid
   saliva samples of both control and CF subjects there were positive
   correlations between flow rate and calcium, flow rate and sodium,
   anylase and calcium, and sodium and calcium, and negative
   correlations between sodium and potassium. The parotid function test
   has no value as a diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis, as even
   calcium values show too much overlap with control saliva to be of
   diagnostic worth.

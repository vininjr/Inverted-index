AB On a 'normal' diet increased faecal bile acid excretion was found in
   14 of 16 children with cystic fibrosis who had steatorrhoea, but
   excretion was normal in 2 such children without steatorrhoea. The 16
   children with steatorrhoea took 3 regimens of diet and therapy: a
   'normal' diet with pancreatic enzyme supplements, a diet of reduced
   long-chain triglycerides with added medium-chain triglycerides, and
   the same diet with added pancreatic enzyme supplements. On each of
   these three regimens steatorrhoea and faecal bile acid loss were
   significantly less than on no treatment, with the lowest excretions
   occurring on the diet of reduced long-chain triglycerides with added
   medium-chain triglycerides and pancreatic enzyme supplements.
   Although a reduction in steatorrhoea was nearly always accompanied by
   a decrease in bile acid excretion, the initial bile acid loss was
   very variable and could not be predicted for any given degree of
   steatorrhoea. This suggests that at least one other factor, possibly
   liver disease or bile acid pool size, influences bile acid loss in
   the faeces.

EX Water, electrolyte and macromolecular secretion, which is affected in
   cystic fibrosis, is regulated by neurotransmitters of the autonomic
   nervous system stimulating the cells by binding to alpha-adrenergic,
   beta-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.  Therefore, a genetic
   disturbance in cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) response
   could eventually explain some of the manifold expressions of labile
   biochemical changes observed in CF, specially in tissue culture.  We
   further characterized beta-receptors in cultured fibroblasts of CF
   patients and normal controls and investigated isoproterenol and
   prostaglandin E1-mediated c-AMP response using defined culture
   conditions.  No significant difference was found between the two
   phenotypes on basal c-AMP values.  With the exception of one cell
   line, CF strains had 25 to 180% increased c-AMP content.  This
   difference is highly significant (p < 0.0025).  This statistically
   significant difference in response can neither be attributed to
   differences in dose- or time-response curves nor to differential
   c-AMP escape into culture medium.  Since CF cells synthesize more
   c-AMP than controls only in response to isoproterenol but not to
   prostaglandin E1, the alteration which might be responsible for the
   observed phenomenon is probably located proximal of the adenylate
   cyclase at the cells border between intra- and extracellular space.

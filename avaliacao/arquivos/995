AB The chloride electrode sweat test and gravimetric chloride titration
   technic are compared. The two technics gave comparable mean values,
   ogives, equivalent points, and overlap for patients with cystic
   fibrosis and healthy subjects. As a single test with either technic
   has an unacceptable risk for false-positive or false-negative
   results, tests should always be done in pairs. A statistical
   interpretation technic based on prevalence and technical variability
   of the two tests will decrease the number of undiagnosed subjects and
   will define probability of cystic fibrosis in the undiagnosed group.

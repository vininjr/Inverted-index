EX Recently, Antonowicz et al. proposed a simple test for cystic
   fibrosis that could be used to verify the Boehringer-Mannheim
   meconium test result and thus reduce the false-positive incidence.
   The test is based on the detection of lactase activity in meconium.
   The 'lactase test' may be of some value as a confirmatory test when
   used with the BM-mec test although its specificity in this study was
   not as good as previously reported.

EX Chronic illness at any age is unfortunate.  It taxes the strengths
   and resources of the individual and those associated with him.  The
   chronically ill teenager faces difficulties different from those of
   the child or adult.  Illness itself is a burden to the adolescent;
   chronic illness is an even greater burden.  The tasks of maturation
   which must be successfully completed in adolescence are made more
   difficult by chronic ill health.  Impact upon the patient,
   educational needs, sexuality needs, life expectancy, impact upon the
   family, and impact upon society are examined.  Specific illnesses,
   such as diabetes mellitus and fibrocystic disease, are discussed.

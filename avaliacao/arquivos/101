EX This letter is prompted by recent reports of favourable results
   after the use of an artificial diet consisting of a protein
   hydrolysate, a glucose polymer, and medium-chain glycerides in the
   treatment of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.  It has been our
   observation that children often find these preparations unpleasant
   and unpalatable.  Loose motions, nausea, and vomiting are quite
   common.  I have comparable experience with their use in other
   malabsorption states and advanced protein-calorie malnutrition.
   Whether the untoward effects result from excessive flooding of gut
   and/or exceedingly high blood-amino acid levels is a matter of
   speculation.

AB Lung lavage samples from rats treated in a chronic fashion with
   reserpine had mean increases of 133, 170, and 120% in the total
   protein, lipid, and carbohydrate contents, respectively, when
   compared with those of untreated control animals, when these values
   were expressed in terms of body weight.  An acute single ip
   injection of the beta-adrenergic agent isoproterenol (10 mg)
   increased the glycoprotein content of pulmonary lavage fluid from
   control rats approximately 15-19%, but only 9-10% in those from
   reserpine treated rats.  By contrast, pilocarpine (10 mg),
   administered in the same manner, caused a 15% increase in the total
   protein, carbohydrate, and lipid content of lavage samples from
   control rats and increased these same constituents in the lavage
   samples of reserpine treated rats 98, 102, and 80%, respectively.
   The increased  total carbohydrate content in the lavage samples of
   the treated animals was not associated with changes in the percent
   distribution of neutral sugars, amino sugars, or sialic acid.  The
   ratio of these various sugar components did not change in the lavage
   samples of control or reserpine treated rats upon stimulation with
   either pilocarpine or isoproterenol.  The increased total lipid
   content fround in the lavage samples from the treated rats probably
   results from an increase in phospholipids.  A decrease in
   phospholipid content occurred in the lavage samples of reserpine
   treated rats upon stimulation, while the opposite was observed in
   those of control animals.  Chronic treatment of rats with reserpine,
   thus, appears to induce an enhanced production of glycoproteins in
   the airways and to interfere with phospholipid metabolism in the
   lung.  In addition, the drug treatment enhances the secretory
   response to pilocarpine in comparison with the responses of control
   animals.  The enhanced response or hypersecretion of glycoproteins
   is a quantitative one and does not seem to involve alterations in
   the ratios or distribution of the various sugar components.  This
   disturbance in the secretory function of the respiratory tract, a
   target organ which is prominently involved in cystic fibrosis (CF)
   together with alterations in other exocrine glands which resemble
   those of CF patients, makes the reserpine treated rat a useful model
   for further study of possible pathogenetic mechanisms in CF.  The
   experimental animal model for CF developed by the chronic
   administration of reserpine to rats has been found to have changes
   in the protein content of lung lavage samples, in addition to
   morphologic and secretory alterations in the salivary glands and the
   pancreas.  Further analysis of the organic composition of lung
   lavage samples shows that the protein, carbohydrate, and lipid
   contents are significantly increased after chronic reserpine
   administration and that the response to stimulation with pilocarpine
   is enhanced in the treated animals when compared to that of
   untreated control rats.  It therefore appears that chronic reserpine
   administration causes a hypersecretion of glycoproteins and changes
   in lipid metabolism in the respiratory tract of the rat and that, in
   conjunction with previous findings in other exocrine glands, these
   effects on lung function make the reserpine treated rat a useful
   tool for the study of the pathologic disturbance seen in the major
   exocrine glands affected in CF.

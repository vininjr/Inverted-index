AB The retrograde perfusion assay in the rat parotid gland was used to
   investigate the effects of salivary secretions from control and
   reserpine-treated rats on Na+ reabsorption. Results demonstrated that
   submaxillary saliva from the treated animals caused a 69% inhibition
   of Na+ reabsorption, accompanied by a 28% reduction in the volume of
   saliva secreted, and a 22% reduction in flow rate. By contrast,
   submaxillary saliva from control rats caused a 6% inhibition of Na+
   reabsorption, a 6% reduction in volume, and a 5% reduction in flow
   rate. Parotid saliva from reserpine-treated rats also inhibited Na+
   reabsorption to the extent of 39% and caused a 38% reduction in
   volume and a 33% reduction in flow. Parotid saliva from control rats
   only inhibited Na+ reabsorption to the extent of 2.7% and caused a 4--
   6% reduction in salivary volumes and flow rates. The inhibition of
   Na+ reabsorption and the reduction in salivary volume and flow rates
   caused by submaxillary saliva of reserpine-treated rats were either
   abolished or significantly reduced when the saliva was previously
   heated to 100 degrees C, frozen, and then thawed or kept in glass
   tubes at 4 degrees C for 24 hr. These results indicate that saliva
   from reserpine-treated rats have comparable effects in this assay
   system to those of saliva from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and
   further support its use as an animal model for this disease.

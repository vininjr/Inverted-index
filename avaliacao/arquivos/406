EX Prolactin is credited to have a role in the maintenance of
   electrolytic and water balance by the kidneys although its effect on
   the composition of sweat is unknown.  We assayed prolactin, growth
   hormone and alpha-fetoprotein in the sera of 69 children with cystic
   fibrosis attending the Hospital for Sick Children.  Sera from 12
   children without cystic fibrosis were used as control.  It appears
   that children with cystic fibrosis have serum levels of prolactin, GH
   and alpha-FP similar to those without this disease and that children
   have significantly higher levels of alpha-FP than women of
   reproductive age.

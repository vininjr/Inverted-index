AB To date, most cases of cystic fibrosis have been treated in
   pediatric hospitals.  With changes and advances in treatment,
   patients who were once considered terminally ill are now living into
   adulthood.  The stresses that result from chronic illness are
   considered herein from the standpoint of the social caseworker, who
   plans a crucial role on the patient-care team.  New problems
   regarding the personal development of the patient are presented,
   with particular emphasis on the role of a CF patient as a parent.
   The role of the respiratory therapist in the care of such patients
   is unique.  This is due to the extensiveness of patient contact,
   both verbal and physical, and to the primary threat that pulmonary
   disease poses to the patient with CF.  The therapist's ability to
   cope with the problem, while aiding the family and patient to do the
   same, becomes crucial to the child's rehabilitation.  The
   requirements for fulfilling this role are educational and
   developmental in nature, and should be pursued as a model for future
   patient care.

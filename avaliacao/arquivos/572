AB Sera and lymphocyte culture media derived from cystic fibrosis (CF)-
   affected and carrier subjects contain ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF)
   detected by our rabbit tracheal bioassay. In addition, we also find
   CDF in fibroblast media from these same donors and in amniotic fluid
   cell media derived from CF carrier or affected fetuses. In these
   latter instances, the media were inactive in the bioassay, but became
   active when mixed with purified IgG. In all instances, CDF activity
   was eliminated by the addition of anti-IgG. We have separated a low
   molecular weight fraction, between 1,000 and 10,000 M.W., from CF
   sera and culture media which is inactive in the bioassay until IgG is
   added. Presumptive and indirect evidence indicates that this fraction
   behaves similarly to the complement derived anaphylatoxin C3a. In
   addition, we have found activity in sera from CF patients and, to a
   lesser extent, carriers that induces degranulation of cytochalasin-B-
   treated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Since this activity
   appears to be in a different molecular species from that containing
   CDF, we postulate that the primary defect in CF is the deficiency of
   an enzyme whose substrates include a family of membrane-active
   molecules.

EX According to Schwachman and Holsclaw, a cystic-fibrosis child who
   does not present with meconium ileus and who receives optimum care
   now has an 80% chance of reaching adulthood.  The main feature
   needing continuous medical care in the older CF patient is
   persisting, and often progressive, chest disease.  CF patients often
   owe their lives to paediatrician and to parents who have persevered
   with an arduous and exacting treatment regimen.  Now that such
   patients are reaching adult life, we must continue to offer the best
   possible support.

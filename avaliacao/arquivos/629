AB Validation of rigid-tube bronchoscopy with small-volume (5-ml
   increments not to exceed 300 ml) bronchial washing as a therapeutic
   adjunct was performed on six patients with cystic fibrosis, using
   serial tests of pulmonary function as a yardstick for assessment of
   efficacy. Two patients did not undergo the procedure and served as
   control subjects. All patients were characterized as having varying
   severity of pulmonary involvement. Large central airways were
   severely obstructed, and older patients had more trapped gas in their
   lungs. Hypoxemia and large alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure
   differences [P(A-a)O2] were due to inhomogeneity of alveolar
   ventilation. Results indicated that up to ten days to two weeks,
   bronchoscopic bronchial washing may in some instances improve maximal
   expiratory flow-volume curves and specific airway conductance and
   decrease P(A-a)O2 towards normal. Distribution of alveolar gas P(A-
   a)O2 towards normal. Distribution of alveolar gas became more
   homogeneous. We conclude that bronchoscopic bronchial washing may be
   effective in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis, by
   augmentation of their inadequate cleansing function of the conducting
   airways.

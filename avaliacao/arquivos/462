AB The amylase in sera of 20 patients with cystic fibrosis of the
   pancreas (CFP), 17 of whom had pancreatic insufficiency (PI), and of
   34 normal control subjects was separated into its pancreatic and
   salivary components and quantitated. Electrophoretic separation was
   achieved on polyacrylamide disc gels with subsequent sectioning of
   the gel columns. The amylase content in international units per liter
   (IU/L.) was obtained for each section by the insoluble blue starch
   substrate method. The mean total serum amylase of the CFP patients
   with PI was significantly lower than the control group. A highly
   significant decrease was found when the pancreatic isoamylase was
   considered alone. The salivary isoamylase level remained essentially
   the same. Three patients with CFP but without PI demonstrated higher
   than normal pancreatic amylase values in the serum. These patients
   may be in an early stage of a progressive involvement of the pancreas
   in which there is an increased release of amylase. This method of
   electrophoretic separation and quantitation of the serum amylase is
   sensitive and efficient and allows the simultaneous processing of
   multiple specimens. The results obtained agree with previously
   published ratios of serum isoamylases. Our method should be valuable
   in the study of other diseases of the exocrine pancreas and salivary
   glands.

EX Hosli has published a hypothesis relating to the primary cause of
   cystic fibrosis (CF) based on his observations that the level of
   alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in CF-derived skin fibroblasts, but not
   fibroblasts derived from normal individuals, could be increased
   several-fold by growing the cells in the presence of the urinary
   glycoprotein, Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP).  However, we have not been
   able to show, in Adelaide, any change or induction in the level of
   ALP activity in CF-derived skin fibroblasts when grown in the
   presence of locally prepared THP under what appear to be identical
   cell culture conditions to those used by Hosli.  It thus appears that
   under the conditions currently employed in our laboratory, there is
   no diagnostic discrimination between fibroblasts of CF homozygotes
   and normal individuals.

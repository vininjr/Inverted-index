EX We have measured immunoreactive trypsin IRT activity in dried blood
   spot samples and have found abnormally high levels in infants with
   cystic fibrosis (CF).  We agree with Crossley et al. that this test
   deserves further investigation as a screen for CF in the newborn.
   The low value for the 94 week infant is consistent with their finding
   that, in children with low pancreatic enzyme output, the increased
   IRT results are restricted to the first few months of life.  It
   remains to be proved whether older CF patients with residual
   pancreatic enzyme secretion do indeed continue to have increased IRT
   levels.  If they do, the IRT test would also deserve further
   investigation as a tool, to be used in conjunction with stool
   pancreatic enzyme activity, in smaller centres who have had problems
   with inaccurate sweat tests.

EX The article by Townes et al. provides confirmation of our initial
   studies with reference to the isoamylase patterns of serum, duodenal
   fluid, and urine in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  However, the
   impression given by Townes et al. in their article is that their data
   are the first demonstration of isoamylase abnormalities in cystic
   fibrosis.  I wish to point out that out previous work published 2
   years earlier and not referenced by Townes et al. demonstrated that
   CF patients had decreased amounts of pancreatic isoamylase in their
   serum and urine and that the duodenal aspirates in CF patients
   contained both salivary and pancreatic amylase.  We concluded, as
   eluded to by Townes et al., that salivary amylase in the duodenal
   fluid was probably secondary to the intubation procedure.

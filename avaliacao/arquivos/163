EX It has been suggested that the development of goiter and
   hypothyroidism in patients receiving chronic iodide therapy indicates
   that they have underlying thyroid disease.  In 1971, Dolan and
   Gibson, in a retrospective study, reviewed the records of children
   with cystic fibrosis receiving chronic expectorant therapy with
   iodide and reported that approximately 85 percent had goiter and 15
   percent suggestive clinical findings of hypothyroidism.  This study,
   together with the fact that the thyroid, like lung and pancreas, is
   of endodermal origin raised the possibility that patients with cystic
   fibrosis might have an underlying defect in thyroid function.  As
   thyroid function in patients with cystic fibrosis has not been
   evaluated in a systematic fashion, the present study was undertaken.
   In it, we have evaluated basal thyroid function in a large group of
   patients with cystic fibrosis and have, in addition, observed the
   effects of chronic iodide administration.  The present study strongly
   suggests that there often occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis
   some derangement in thyroid hormone economy.  The frequency with
   which iodides increased serum thyrotropin, decreased serum thyroxine
   concentration, and induced goiter, with or without hypothyroidism, in
   patients with cystic fibrosis, points strongly to the presence of an
   intrinsic abnormality of the thyroid in this disease.  The nature of
   such abnormality remains unclear.

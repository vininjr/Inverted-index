EX Our laboratory has reported abnormal polyamine levels in extracted
   whole blood from individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).  Since an
   abnormality in putrescine uptake in CF fibroblasts would imply a
   direct relationship to the genetic lesion, we initiated studies to
   confirm and possible extend this observation.  There is no
   significant increase in the Vmax of CF fibroblasts as compared to
   values obtained for control cells.  We conclude that with our growth
   and assay conditions, in which we attempted to duplicate those
   described in the original investigation, there is no consistent or
   significant increase in the Vmax of putrescine uptake in CF
   fibroblasts.

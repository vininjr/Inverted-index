EX Fibrocystic disease is a common disease of childhood and the pancreas
   is abnormal in 90% of these cases.  There is fibrosis with atrophy of
   the exocrine parenchymal tissue, but islet cell tissue is rarely
   involved.  Mucous glands throughout the body are grossly distended
   and they secrete an abnormal viscid mucus.  Sweat glands appear
   normal, but they secrete sweat with an abnormally high concentration
   of electrolytes.  A characteristic feature of the disease is the
   widespread chronic bronchiolitis.  This is due to the Staphylococcus
   aureus which grow best in a salt-rich medium.

EX Patients with cystic fibrosis have a higher concentration of sodium
   and chloride in their sweat than normals.  This observation led to
   the introduction of an iontophoresis technique for stimulating the
   sweat glands with pilocarpine.  Occasionally, electrical burns result
   from defective equipment or from an incorrect or badly applied test
   procedure.  A new design of equipment is presented which eliminates
   the possibility of a burn during the test.

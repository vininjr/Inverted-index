AB An account is given of screening for the early detection of disease
   in Great Britain today.  The organisation of screening programmes
   provided nationally for the whole population is described.  These
   include programmes for prenatal care, screening of infants,
   screening of schoolchildren, and screening of women for carcinoma in
   situ of the uterine cervix.  Selective screening programmes for
   tuberculosis and for various industrial diseases are mentioned.
   Experience in provision of these services on a national scale has
   emphasised the importance of evaluating future screening programmes,
   before they are implemented, by research studies on their
   effectiveness, their possibly harmful side effects, and their cost.
   Evidence from research in screening for a number of diseases is very
   briefly summarized, and it is concluded that there may be some
   development of programmes for the early detection and treatment of
   hypertension and of breast cancer, but for other diseases and for
   multiphasic screening, evidence so far available is insufficient to
   warrant any immediate extension from research towards service.

AB The average blood serotonin level of 67 children with cystic fibrosis
   was found to be about twice that of age-matched normal children.
   There was no corresponding increase in the urinary excretion of 5-
   hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Children with cystic fibrosis were
   well able to metabolize serotonin taken by mouth. No significant
   correlations were found between the blood serotonin level and the
   platelet count, height, weight, skinfold thickness, and pulmonary
   function test, 5 out of 44 patients had raised serum IgE levels, and
   their mean blood serotonin was higher than in those with normal IgE
   levels. No explanation for this emerged. Comparable findings (raised
   blood serotonin normal platelet count, normal urinary 5-HIAA) have
   been reported only in severe mental retardation. Further study of
   this phenomenon is warranted because (a) a raised blood serotonin
   level is sufficiently characteristic of cystic fibrosis to explore
   its use in diagnosis, and (b) it may help to explain the pathogenesis
   of cystic fibrosis and (c) the metabolism and function of serotonin.

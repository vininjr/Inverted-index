AB Skin tests and exercise tests were performed on children with cystic
   fibrosis (CF) and first-degree relatives of CF children. Positive
   skin tests were found in 56% of patients and 19% of relatives, but
   the prevalence of atopy in CF patients bore no relationship to its
   prevalence in their relatives. Increased 0ronchial lability, mainly
   due to bronchoconstriction, was present in 54% of patients and 27% of
   relatives. The results showed that increased prevalence of bronchial
   lability, but not atopy, is found in first-degree relatives of CF
   children, and that the abnormal lability and atopy found in CF
   children does not indicate a familial allergic background.

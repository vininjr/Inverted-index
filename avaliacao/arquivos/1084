AB The impact of the death of a cystic fibrosis child on subsequent
   family function was evaluated in a retrospective study of 16
   families.  In findings similar to that reported for another model of
   fatal childhood illness, leukemia, there was a high incidence of
   emotional and medical problems in the parents.  There was an
   unexpectedly high incidence (7/16) of incomplete mourning, i.e.,
   maintenance of the child's room as a shrine or weekly grave visit
   for more than six months.  Siblings had less difficulty in adjusting
   to the loss than that reported for the siblings of leukemic
   children.  It is suggested that the prolonged course of a disease
   with a hopeless prognosis prepares the family for the child's death
   but also retards the mourning process.  The family may need
   counseling to ensure that mourning is completed.

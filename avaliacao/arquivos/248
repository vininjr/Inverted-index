AB The frequency of a 'double proximal axial triradius' (DPAT), which
   results in a palmar parathenar pattern, has been reported to be
   increased in those with ventricular septal defect (BSD). We scored
   the presence of this pattern in 313 patients with congenital heart
   defects (including 86 with isolated VSD), 176 with cystic fibrosis
   (CF) or relatives of those with CF, and 333 with no known clinical
   disease who were unrelated to individuals with CF. The frequencies in
   these three groups were 1.6, 2.3, and 0.6%, respectively. None of
   those with isolated VSD defect had a DPAT. All five individuals in
   the heart defect group with a DPAT had pulmonic stenosis. Of the
   total of eleven individuals in our series with DPAT patterns, eight
   were affected only on the right hand. The frequency of DPAT in
   individuals with no known disease in this series was 4/406=1.0%, more
   than double the frequency in a control series, published previously
   by DAVID, 5/1,129=0.4%. If the 73 relatives of those with CF are
   excluded from our own 'control' group, the frequency of DPAT in this
   group is then 0.6%, closer to the results in DAVID's control series.

AB Data on the prevalence of divorce and separation among parents of
   children with cystic fibrosis and other chronic diseases indicate
   that marital breakdown is no more prevalent among these couples than
   it is in a general population.  For couples who attended genetic
   counseling clinics or had children with spina bifida or leukemia,
   the divorce rate is lower than the United States national average.
   For parents of children with cystic fibrosis, the divorce rate is
   the same as the national average.  The high recurrence risk for
   cystic fibrosis may deter many parents from further reproduction.
   We speculate that the inability to plan more children may be the
   factor responsible for the higher prevalence among these parents
   compared to those of children with other chronic diseases.

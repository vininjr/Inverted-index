AB The prominent role of infection in the clinical course of cystic
   fibrosis has led to considerable investigation of possible immune
   deficiency in these patients.  Leukotaxis of circulating phagocytic
   cells and the ability to generate chemotactic factors are important
   in host defenses against bacterial invasion.  These properties were
   investigated in patients with clinically stable cystic fibrosis to
   determine if they possess dysfunctional inflammatory responses which
   would predispose them to severe infection.

AB Sweat from 8 'rusters' and 8 control persons was examined for its
   sodium concentration. Sweating was induced by iontophoresis of
   pilocarpine on the distal forearm. In no case did the concentrations
   exceed the normal upper limit for this procedure, and no difference
   was found between the two groups. In this way the study failed to
   confirm earlier reports of elevated sodium chloride concentrations in
   sweat from 'rusters'. Proposals of a relationship between 'rusters'
   and patients with pancreatic cystic fibrosis were not substantiated.
   Hyperhidrosis of the palms and volar surfaces of the fingers was
   present in all 'rusters'. This seemed to be the main cause of the
   corrosive tendency, and patients referred for palmar hyperhidrosis
   were found to produce corrosion similar to the 'rusters'. Topical
   application of aluminium chloride hexahydrate in a 25% solution in
   absolute ethyl alcohol proved effective against both hyperhidrosis
   and the corrosive tendency.

EX Neonatal peritonitis remains a dangerous condition.  Factors
   complicating diagnosis and management include its low incidence, the
   diversity of aetiological factors found, and the severity of
   underlying or associated disease.  28 cases presenting since 1957 at
   Southmead General Hospital were reviewed.  Thirteen aetiological
   factors relating to mother or baby were found.  13 infants were
   premature, 10 had severe respiratory problems at birth.  Maternal
   hydramnios was present in 7.  6 babies had had exchange transfusion.
   The commonest findings were gangrenous volvulus and cystic fibrosis.
   Combined factors were often present.  The usual presentation is with
   bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass normal
   meconium.  4 cases had distended abdomens at birth.  Plain abdominal
   x-rays are of great diagnostic value.  Pneumoperitoneum is diagnostic
   but absent from early films.  Treatment is surgical.  Close liaison
   with the paediatrician who sees the baby first is essential.  In
   assessing results it is pointed out that many of these babies are
   small and/or suffering from serious conditions such as haemolytic
   disease, cystic fibrosis, or gangrenous volvulus.  8 cases were
   considered unfit for surgery.  Of 20 submitted to surgery, 12
   survived, mostly in the latter part of the series.

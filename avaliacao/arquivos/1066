EX There are certain aspects of the symptomatology of cystic fibrosis
   that bear a resemblance to those of essential fatty acid deficiency.
   We fed a group of patients essential fatty acids orally since
   intravenous administration is not a practical method for long term
   treatment.  Results of the study were varied.  Although some response
   was noted in all patients, there were no consistent clinical changes
   seen in every patient.  The oral EFA therapy effected no change in
   sputum cultures.  After one year of EFA, the sweat sodium
   concentration was lower in all but one patient.  The clinical aspect
   of our study is small, but promising.  The results suggest a role for
   EFAs in the care of CF.  Whether EFA is a factor in the etiology of
   CF or merely a manifestation of malabsorption requires further
   investigation.

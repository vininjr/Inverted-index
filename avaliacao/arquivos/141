AB Arginine esterase activity in chloroform-ellagic acid-treated plasma
   from 11 patients with cystic fibrosis(CF) and 12 age-matched control
   subjects has been resolved into its component fractions by ion
   exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and electrofocusing on
   polyacrylamide gels.  The activity can be resolved into two
   fractions by chromatography, one of which is inhibited by soybean
   trypsin inhibitor (STI) and the other of which is not inhibited by
   STI.  In plasma of CF patients, the fraction of activity inhibited
   by STI is reduced to approximately 30% of the corresponding fraction
   in control plasma.  In contrast, the fraction of activity resistant
   to inhibition by STI did not show any significant quantitative
   differences between control and CF plasma samples.  Analysis of
   plasma samples by electrofocusing on 5% polyacrylamide gels in the
   range of pH 5.0-8.0 and subsequent staining for arginine esterase
   activity showed qualitative differences between control and CF
   plasma samples.  Six activity bands could be detected in control
   samples, whereas five bands were detected in CF samples.  Eight
   samples had one type of band missing, two had another type of band
   missing, and one had yet another type of band missing.  All of these
   bands were restricted to a narrow pH zone in the center of the gel.
   These data are consistent with and extend our earlier reports of
   differences in arginine esterase activity between plasma samples of
   CF patients and control subjects.  The demonstration of the absence
   of a single band of arginine esterase activity is consistent with
   the absence of a specific arginine esterase isoenzyme in patients
   with CF.  The deficiency of arginine esterase in patients with
   cystic fibrosis may account for the presence of "factors" in saliva,
   plasma, and fibroblasts of these patients and consequently for the
   clinical manifestations of the disease.

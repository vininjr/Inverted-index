EX The BM meconium test is a useful screening test for cystic fibrosis.
   However, we have had false-positive results in two babies caused by
   the use of rectal glycerin suppositories.  The babies presented with
   signs suggestive of intestinal obstruction possibly due to meconium
   ileus, and glycerin suppositories were inserted to speed the passage
   of meconium so that the BM test could be done to help confirm the
   diagnosis.  The tests were positive but the babies were subsequently
   shown not to have cystic fibrosis, and we found that the glycerin
   suppositories themselves produce the typical blue colour on the test
   strip.

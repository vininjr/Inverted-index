AB A modified method of analysis of sweat chloride concentration with an
   ion-selective electrode is presented. The original method of sweat
   chloride analysis proposed by the Orion Research Corporation
   (Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139) is inadequate because it produces
   erratic and misleading results. The modified method was compared with
   the reference quantitative method of Gibson and Cooke. In the
   modified method, individual electrode pads are cut and placed in the
   electrodes rather than using the pads supplied by the company;
   pilocarpine nitrate (2,000 mg/l) is used in place of pilocarpine HCl
   (640 mg/l); sodium bicarbonate as the weak electrolyte is used
   instead of K2SO4. A 10-minute period for sweat accumulation is
   employed rather than a zero-time collection as in the original Orion
   method. The modification has been studied for reproducibility in
   individuals, reproducibility between right and left arm in
   individuals; it has been compared extensively with the quantitative
   method of Gibson and Cooke, both in normal individuals and in
   patients with cystic fibrosis. There is excellent agreement between
   the modified method and the quantitative reference method. There
   appears to be a slight bias toward higher concentrations of chloride
   from the right arm compared with the left arm, but this difference is
   not medically significant.

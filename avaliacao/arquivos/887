AB The success in the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus of different
   methods of sputum processing was investigated in 60 specimens
   collected from 14 patients with cystic fibrosis during a seven-month
   period. Fifty specimens (83%) from 11 patients yielded Staph. aureus
   by one or more methods. Direct plating of purulent portions of sputum
   on to media designed for general use in respiratory infections gave
   unsatisfactory results (35% yield of Staph. aureus). Some increase in
   isolations was obtained with preliminary liquefaction of sputum; but
   the best results were given by the addition of a medium selective for
   staphylococci (mannitol salt agar, BBL) or by initial sonication of
   sputum (each 83% yield). Seven of the 11 strains of Staph. aureus
   were thymidine-dependent and otherwise atypical in laboratory
   characteristics; these were isolated from patients who had received
   co-trimoxazole.

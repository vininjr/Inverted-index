EX My colleagues and I reviewed the diagnosis, management, and prognosis
   in 17 cases of infants with cystic fibrosis and severe respiratory
   distress who were admitted to the Children's Hospital Medical Center,
   Boston, between 1968 and 1972.  There was a 60% mortality overall.
   Six of the 17 infants were treated with assisted ventilation, of whom
   only one survived.  Our subsequent experience with assisted
   ventilation has shown no improvement in the survival of these
   infants.

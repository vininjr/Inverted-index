AB The consanguinity of parents (born in France) of individuals who have
   a recessive disease has been studied. The frequency of first cousin
   marriages is less than 0.2% in the general French population. Among
   the parents of affected individuals the following frequencies of
   first cousin matings were observed: cystic fibrosis: 1.4% cystinosis:
   7.1% nephronophtisis: 5.6% spinal muscular atrophy: 4.5% albinism:
   5.0% achromatopsia: 12.5% (Albinism and spinal muscular atrophy are
   heterogeneous conditions). The increase in the frequency of first
   cousin marriage relative to that of the general population is much
   greater, as expected, in cystinosis, which is a rare disease, than in
   cystic fibrosis, which is the most frequent recessive disorder in
   France. Inbreeding in cystinosis and cystic fibrosis was also studied
   by computing the distance between parental birth places. This
   distance is smaller in cystinosis than in cystic fibrosis.

AB Patients who had cystic fibrosis and acute infectious exacerbations
   of pulmonary disease produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were treated
   with a combination of tobramycin and ticarcillin. P. aeruginosa
   recovered from patients was inhibited by lower concentrations of both
   of these drugs than of gentamicin or carbenicillin. Thirteen courses
   of treatment were administered to 11 patients (mean, 14.4 days). A
   favorable response was seen in 11 of 12 completed courses of
   treatment. Improvement was associated with decreases in white blood
   cell count, temperature, and sedimentation rate. Adverse reactions
   were uncommon. Although P. aeruginosa was not eradicated from the
   sputum, the clinical results suggest that the combination of
   tobramycin and ticarcillin may be particularly useful for treatment
   of acute exacerbations of pulmonary disease in patients with cystic
   fibrosis from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.

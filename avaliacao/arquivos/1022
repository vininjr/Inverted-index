EX The control of symptoms in dying children is often sadly neglected.
   This neglect is reflected in a review of the case notes of two
   children who died of cystic fibrosis within three years of each
   other.  The girls were under the care of the same consultant, who in
   the interval between the two cases was introduced to the concern of
   proper terminal care for children.

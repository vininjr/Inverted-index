EX In this article, we will examine the reasons for the prolonged
   survival of individuals with cystic fibrosis as well as discuss the
   pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of this multisystemic disease.
   The reasons for the improved prognosis in CF are multiple: improved
   antibiotic therapy, early diagnosis, specialized care centers, and
   aggressive treatment regimens.  This presents the primary care
   physician with a new and challenging patient population, requiring
   the coordinated effort of the health care team, including
   specialists, nurses, therapists, etc., to achieve effective therapy
   for this truly multisystemic disease.

AB The studies were carried out with view to evaluate development of
   immunoglobulins biosynthesis in children from birth through first
   year of life and up to age of 15 years as well as to establish the
   normal values of each immunoglobulin class in healthy children of
   different age in our conditions of investigations and in our
   geografical, social and economical situation.  There was also under
   consideration the evaluation of body reaction on antigenic
   stimulation and administration of gammaglobulin preparations.  In
   order to determine more broadly the development of these humoral
   immunity parameters in children qualitative and quantitative
   investigations of immunoglobulins were undertaken also in same
   chosen illnesses where changes in biosynthesis and metabolism of
   immunoglobulins may be connected with pathogenesis of illness or
   with type of treatment (cystic fibrosis) (C.F.),
   Ataxia-Telangiectasia syndrome (A-T), pituitary dwarfism,
   fenyloketonuria (PKU).  In some groups of children investigations
   were systematically repeated to evaluate the dynamism of changes.

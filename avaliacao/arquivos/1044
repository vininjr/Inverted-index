EX In the present study, we compared the levels of a series of cultured
   lymphocytic acid-hydrolase enzymes in cystic fibrosis homozygotes,
   heterozygotes and controls; compared the effects of three different
   mitogens on these levels; and studied the effect of CF vs control
   serum in the culture medium.  Our observations provide an entirely
   new interpretation for the apparent changes occurring in lymphocytic
   enzymes during culture of lymphocytes with mitogens, and suggest that
   a serum factor is present in cystic fibrosis serum that mimics
   mitogens in this regard.  Lymphocytic acid-hydrolases and total
   protein are present in higher concentrations in lymphocytes cultured
   for 48 hours without mitogen when CF homozygous or heterozygous serum
   is present in the culture media.  This appears to result from a CF
   serum factor that has mitogen-like activity and prevents loss of cell
   protein during culture.  Responsiveness of the cellular proteins to
   mitogens is blunted when CF serum is present in the culture media,
   either because the cell proteins are already maximally stimulated by
   the CF serum factor, or the factor blocks or modifies the action of
   mitogens on lymphocyte protein content.  This phenomenon is useful
   for detection of CF heterozygosity, and appears to reflect the
   genetic abnormality causing cystic fibrosis.

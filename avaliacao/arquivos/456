EX The Paediatric Gastroenterology Clinic at this hospital was started
   to follow children with gastroenterological problems after discharge
   from hospital and in particular to monitor their clinical and dietary
   progress.  Other dietitians who see an opening for this work in their
   hospitals may find our experiences to be of interest.  Gluten-free
   diets, cow's milk free diets, sugar intolerance, cystic fibrosis, and
   non-specific cases are discussed.

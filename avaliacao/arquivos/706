AB Serotyping of 30 mucoid strains isolated from cystic fibrosis
   patients was carried out by slide agglutination tests with both live
   and heat-killed cells and by tube agglutination test with heat-killed
   cells. Comparison of the results obtained by these 2 methods revealed
   that tube agglutination with heat-killed cells was the superior
   method. More than half the strains were found to be Homma's serotype
   15 (group M in the new schema [2]). Slide agglutination with live
   cells did not give clear results: some strains showed occasionally
   positive or negative agglutinations against the same serotype serum.
   Changes in serotypes (groups in the new schema [2]) were found in
   some strains, although the number was very small.

EX In 1969 Danes and Bearn proposed that the metachromasia noted in
   short-term white-blood-cell cultures from both cystic fibrosis
   (C.F.) homozygotes and heterozygotes probably reflected uptake of
   heparin from the culture-medium by pinocytosis and not, as in the
   genetic mucopolysaccharidoses, stored mucopolysaccharides.  This
   hypothesis was recently confirmed by Robertson et al.  Using
   35S-heparin they demonstrated an increased uptake of heparin in
   short-term C.F. white-blood-cell cultures which corresponded to the
   observations made on the basis of staining.  However, as mentioned
   in 1971 by Bafalluy et al., any white blood-cell in culture can be
   overloaded with heparin.  As the processes involved in endocytosis
   and exocytosis probably are inconstant within one cell and
   certainly in different cell types, standardisation of cytoplasmic
   retention of heparin may not be possible in order to eliminate the
   partial overlap between normals, C.F. homozygotes and obligatory
   heterozygotes observed by Robertson et al.  This report on
   35S-heparin again raised the question of the significance of
   cellular mucopolysaccharides in cystic fibrosis.  The relevance of
   mucopolysaccharides in the C.F. cultured cell is still unclear.
   Between 1968 and 1970 the mucopolysaccharide content of the
   cultured fibroblast was reported as normal and variable.

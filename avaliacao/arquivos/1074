AB Quantitative and functional assessments were made of both the
   classical and alternative pathways of complement activation in sera
   from 23 patients with cystic fibrosis. The classical pathway
   functioned similarly in patients and controls as measured by CH50
   titre. Alternative pathway function, initiated in patient sera by
   incubation with inulin, was equal to that of controls as determined
   by cleavage of Factor B and C3, and by the consumption of terminal
   components. Factor B, however, was more readily activated in patient
   than in control sera. This rapid alteration of Factor B did not lead
   to accelerated or more extensive activation of the terminal
   complement components via the alternative pathway when assessed by C3
   cleavage and the consumption of terminal components. Thus, a
   complement deficiency was not found. The importance of the easily
   activated Factor B is undefined.

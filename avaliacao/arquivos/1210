EX Several cystic fibrosis research groups have independently attempted
   to reproduce the isoelectric focusing work of Wilson et al.  The
   protocol that we employed with the LKB Mulitphor electrofocusing
   apparatus was that of Wilson et al., although fixing and staining of
   the polyacrylamide gels was performed in a boiling water bath for 30
   min.  In 10 of 11 sera from patients with CF, the cystic fibrosis
   protein band was directly identified by each of two independent
   observers and in the sera from nine obligate heterozygote
   individuals, the CFP band was noted in seven and eight instances by
   each observer, respectively.  In sera from 26 normal control
   individuals, the CFP band was observed in two instances.  Our results
   would support the view that the CFP band is indeed directly
   identifiable in both CT heterozygote and homozygote sera without
   recourse to photographic image enhancement and that its frequency of
   occurrence is similar to that reported previously.

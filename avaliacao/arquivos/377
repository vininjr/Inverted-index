EX I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for
   cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their
   disappointment at not finding any difference between the life
   expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of
   all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what
   should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early
   as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly
   all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an
   evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically,
   one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with
   a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's
   report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief:
   only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age.
   Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting
   cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large
   delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.

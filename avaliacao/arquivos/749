AB The cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) and ciliary dyskinesia activities
   (CDA) in sera from CF homozygotes, heterozygote carriers, and
   individuals with bronchial asthma have been partially purified.
   Concurrently, the CDA's in sera from patients with cystic fibrosis
   (CF) or bronchial asthma were shown to be different substances by ion-
   exchange or gel permeation chromatographic procedures. Sephadex G-200
   chromatography indicated that the CF-CDA eluted with a protein
   fraction of molecular weight (MW) 68,000-150,000 and that the asthma
   CDA was found in a protein fraction of MV greater than 150,000. The
   two activities could also be separated by DEAE-cellulose
   chromatography. Prior acidification of whole normal, CF homozygote,
   obligate heterozygote, or asthmatic sera to pH 3.7 using EDTA,
   followed by fractionation of Sephadex G-200 removed all the CDA's
   from fractions of highermolecular  weight and shifted the activities
   to a protein fraction of MW 1,100-13,700. This procedure afforded a
   200-fold purification of the CDA's in sera from patients with asthma
   or CF. EDTA treatment, however, also generated a CDA in previously
   nonreactive normal sera. Subsequent fractionation of the various
   active G-200 fractions on Bio-Gel P10 allowed for the separation of
   three separate activities (Bio-Gel Fractions I, II-IV, and V).
   Fraction I was shown to represent the activity in sera from patients
   with asthma and was determined to be C3a (MW 9,000). Fraction I was
   also found in normal, CF, and carrier sera and therefore is not a
   specific CDA. Fraction II-IV is thought to represent a CF-specific
   CDA (MW 5,000) since it could not be demonstrated in either normal or
   asthmatic sera but was found in sera of obligate heterozygotes.
   Fraction III-IV also did not react with antisera to human C3a.
   Fraction V was generated from all serum types upon acidification of
   the serum with EDTA and is thought to be a nonspecific CDA. Bio-Gel
   P10 filtration of Sephadex G-200 fractions provided 823-fold and 650-
   fold purification of the asthmatic and CF CDA's, respectively.
   Concurrent analysis of column fractions for CDA's by bioassay and for
   CFP by electrofocusing showed CFP only in fractions that contained
   the CF-CDA. Combined analyses employing acid disc gel
   electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and EDTA treatment of active
   CF-immunoglobulin (Ig) G and Sephadex G-200 column fractions,
   followed by Bio-Gel P10 chromatography, provided evidence that CFP
   was associated with the CF-CDA. It is unknown as yet whether CFP
   itself is responsible for the CF-CDA activity.

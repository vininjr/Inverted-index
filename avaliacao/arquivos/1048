AB Ten of fifteen cystic fibrosis children with positive skin prick
   tests to common antigens gave an immediate bronchial reaction to the
   antigen inhaled, five of them also gave a late reaction; however only
   one gave a history of asthma. The antigen most commonly eliciting a
   positive skin reaction in cystic fibrosis patients is Aspergillus
   fumigatus. In six children tested to this antigen the bronchial
   response varied, two were negative, one gave an immediate reaction
   and three gave a dual (immediate and late) reaction. None of the
   children showed the characteristic pattern of response to exercise
   seen in asthmatic patients, an initial rise in Peak Expiratory Flow
   Rate followed by a fall of greater than 14% below the resting level.
   Two patients showed an abnormal rise in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate
   during exercise, a pattern described previously in cystic fibrosis.
   The results suggest that bronchial allergy, immediate or late does
   completely explain susceptibility to asthma, and that other factors
   including perhaps the type of bronchial reactivity shown by
   bronchoconstriction after exercise may be required. However the
   majority of the children tested had bronchial allergy and anti-
   allergy therapy such as inhaled sodium cromoglycate may have a place
   in the management of selected patients with cystic fibrosis.

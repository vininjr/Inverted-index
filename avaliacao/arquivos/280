EX We read with interest Dr Raine's paper but would like to stress that
   Hellsing and Kollberg used a single radial immunodiffusion method
   not radioimmunoassay.  Prosser et al. demonstrated quite clearly
   that similar results were obtained in cystic-fibrosis (C.F.)
   screening with test-strips and with more elaborate methods of
   albumin detection in meconium.  Using both radial immunodiffusion as
   well as test-strips, Kollberg's group noticed a decreased albumin
   content in C.F. meconium stored at room temperature and mailed for
   several days.  Diminished albumin concentration might have been
   brought about by remaining proteolytic activity.  Prosser et al.
   found no change in albumin content during refrigerator storage.
   Approximately 10% of C.F. cases have no raised albumin content in
   meconium and this problem has not yet been solved.

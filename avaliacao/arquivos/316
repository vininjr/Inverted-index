AB The effects of acute diuresis in patients with cor pulmonale
   secondary to cystic fibrosis were studied. Both hemodynamic
   parameters and arterial blood gas changes were investigated. The
   major effect noted was a significant reduction of systemic venous
   pressure. Pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge pressure either
   remained constant or declined slightly. No consistent changes were
   noted in cardiac output or arterial blood gases. Acute diuresis of
   moderate degree appears to be a safe and effective manner in which to
   treat the systemic venous congestion of cor pulmonale in this
   situation.

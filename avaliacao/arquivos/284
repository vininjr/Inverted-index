EX We believe that serum-levels of individual complement components in
   children cannot be meaningfully interpreted unless they are compared
   with normal values obtained from age-matched controls.  In a study
   of 163 healthy infants and children we found a statistically
   significant correlation of C3 levels with age, but not with sex or
   race, and we also found a wide range of values within any given
   age-group.  In contrast to previous reports, we did not find raised
   C3 levels in the majority of our C.F. patients when the values were
   compared with projected group mean values for the appropriate age,
   and we did not find a significant elevation of the mean C3 level for
   the C.F. patients in any of the age-groups tested.

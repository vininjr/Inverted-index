AB Elevated calcium and protein concentration are a consistent
   abnormality in submaxillary saliva from patients with cystic fibrosis
   (CF) and from experimental animal models developed by the chronic
   administration of either isoproterenol (IPR) or reserpine. The
   possibility that the effects of the two drugs may be additive was
   investigated by assessing their combined effects on glandular and
   salivary C++ and protein in the rat submaxillary gland. Individually,
   their effects were also assessed in relation to the dose used.
   Results indicate that: (1) treatment for 7 days with 0.05, 0.50, and
   5.0 mg/kg daily dose of reserpine caused, respectively, a 45%, 95%,
   and 120% increase in glandular Ca++ and a 9.3%, 16.5%, and 37.4%
   increase in glandular protein; (2) treatment for 7 days with a 5.0
   mg/kg daily dose of isoproterenol caused a 138% increase in gland
   Ca++ and a 12.38% increase in gland protein. Treatment with a 5.0
   mg/rat daily dose of this drug caused increases of 166% and 10.3% in
   gland Ca++ and protein; (3) in experiments involving a combination of
   the two drugs, isoproterenol was administered in a 5.0 mg/kg daily
   dose from days 1-7 and reserpine in a 0.5 mg/kg daily dose from days
   4-10 of the treatment schedule. This procedure resulted in (a) a 217%
   increase in gland Ca++ and a 25.7% increase in gland protein; (b) a
   marked accumulation of a granular, basophilic material in acinar
   cells and the development of intraductal precipitates; (c) the
   secretion of turbid saliva with high Ca++ and protein concentrations
   after a secretory dose of isoproterenol (this type of stimulation
   also reduced the gland Ca++ (50%) and protein (20%) contents and
   produced vacuolization in the acinar cells); (d) the secretion of
   saliva with elevated Ca++ and protein in response to pilocarpine
   (these elevated concentrations were, however, one-fifth of those
   obtained after isoproterenol stimulation); (e) the secretion of
   smaller volume of saliva after both types of stimulation. These
   findings indicate that both IPR and reserpine have a dose-related and
   significant effect on submaxillary gland Ca++ and protein and that
   their individual effects are synergistic. The implications of this
   synergism for the physiologic state of the submaxillary gland and for
   the secretory abnormality of cystic fibrosis are discussed.

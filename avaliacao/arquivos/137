AB The retrograde perfusion assay of Magos for the sodium reabsorption
   inhibitory effect in sweat and mixed saliva from patients with
   cystic fibrosis (CF) was modified by (1) using the second parotid
   gland of the rat as a control, (2) carefully controlling the
   quantity of saliva perfused into the rat parotid gland so that the
   ratio of milliliters perfused to gram dry gland weight fell between
   1.8 and 2.8, and (3) reporting the inhibitory effect as percentage
   of inhibition of the rate of sodium reabsorption (RNa) in the
   perfused gland calculated from the difference between the RNa's in
   the two glands.  Using this modified assay we were able to confirm
   that significant differences exist in the percentage of inhibition
   of RNa caused by CF and normal mixed saliva (47.0 plus or minus 24.8
   and 18.0 plus or minus 8.3, mean plus or minus SD).  In addition,
   similar significant differences in the percentage of inhibition of
   RNa by submandibular gland secretions (39.7 plus or minus 13.5 and
   16.0 plus or minus 11.8), sublingual gland secretions (39.5 plus or
   minus 6.0 and 19.7 plus or minus 14.3), and submucosal gland
   secretions (34.0 plus or minus 11.7 and 21.7 plus or minus 12.7)
   between CF and normal subjects were observed.  However, parotid
   gland secretions from CF subjects showed no increased inhibitory
   effect (12.5 plus or minus 7.9 and 12.5 plus or minus 6.6).  These
   findings demonstrate that the sodium reabsorption inhibitory effect
   is produced by the secretions from some but not all salivary glands
   of patients with CF.

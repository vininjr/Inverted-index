   PREGNANCY.
EX Following Rao and Nadlers' report of decrease arginine activity in
   the blood of patients with cystic fibrosis we have been trying to
   apply their findings to the prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
   We were therefore most interested in the reports on the use of
   4-methylumbelliferyl-rho-guanidinobenzoate (MUGB) for assaying
   arginine esterase activity in amniotic fluid.  Our results with MUGB
   are similar to those of Brock and Haywood but are substantially
   higher than those of Walsh and Nedler.  A sample of amniotic fluid
   that had been incubated with MUGB and then assayed with
   pro-phe-arg-4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amide (PPA-MCA) showed less than 20%
   of the activity of a similarly treated control sample that had not
   been incubated with MUGB.  The activity of arginine esterase towards
   PPA-MCA both in amniotic fluid and in cultures amniotic fluid cells
   is much greater than towards CBZ-Arg-AMC.  These levels of activity
   are high enough to warrant further investigation for use in an
   antenatal diagnosis.

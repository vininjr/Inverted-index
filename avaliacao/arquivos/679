AB Various doses of two whole-virus and one split-product bivalent
   influenza A/New Jersey/76-A/Victoria/75 vaccines were administered to
   253 children aged six to 18 years. There were no statistically
   significant differences in either reactivity or humoral antibody
   response among the 167 children in seven chronic disease categories
   and 86 healthy children. The whole-virus vaccines were associated
   with unacceptably high rates of reaction when given in sufficiently
   antigenic initial doses but were relatively nonreactive when used for
   booster immunization. Split-product vaccines were no more reactive
   than placebo. All vaccine preparations induced adequate
   seroconversion rates and protective titers of antibody to A/Victoria
   virus after one dose and to A/New Jersey virus after two doses.

AB The apparent frequency of the recessive autosomal allele for cystic
   fibrosis (cf) is too high to be satisfactorily explained by mutation
   equilibrium. However, higher reproductive fitness by heterozygotes
   (expressed by t greater than 0) or higher gametic viability of the cf
   allele (expressed by a greater than 0.5) can provide reasonable
   explanations of the present frequency. Furthermore, birth replacement
   in families with CF children (RPE) can account for the estimated
   historical values of t. Today, however, t is probably at or
   approaching zero as a result of discontinuation of RPE. In the future
   we can look for an imperceptibly slow decrease in the incidence of
   CF. Reproduction by CF females will not cause an increase in
   incidence; it will only slightly slow the rate of decrease.

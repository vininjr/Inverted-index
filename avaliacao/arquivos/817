   METHODS.
AB Screening of sweat chloride in newborn infants with the Orion Skin
   Chloride Measuring System and incorporating some procedural
   innovations is described. The results indicate that while diagnostic
   screening for cystic fibrosis can be readily undertaken, the test
   with the chloride ion-selective electrode is best left at least to
   the second day of life or later because of insufficient sweating in
   very young babies. Measurements on 2 babies with cystic fibrosis are
   also discussed.

EX We were interested in Professor Elliott's description of early skin
   wrinkling in children with cystic fibrosis.  Although this
   phenomenon may well be related to osmotic differences between skin
   and water, it has been observed that skin wrinkling (as seen on the
   finger pulp) is fully dependent on an intact peripheral
   nerve-supply.  This is a useful sign in peripheral nerve lesions
   and helpful in following recovery when the wrinkling returns.
   Furthermore, it was our impression that in normal individuals
   wrinkling was more apparent on the left hand than on the
   right-handed individuals.  However, in a preliminary study using
   fingerprint densities measured by photometry, no significant
   differences were found between the sides.

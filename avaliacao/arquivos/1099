EX Mitchell and co-workers conclude that bronchial hyperreactivity is
   common in cystic fibrosis (CF) but is different from that in asthma.
   Their data were interesting, but I do not agree with their
   conclusion.  One can interpret these data as suggesting a common
   reversible component in both patient groups, and perhaps a common
   denominator in mechanism.  Because of certain problems with baseline
   measurements and withholding of medication, it seems that the
   conclusion of Mitchell et al may not be well supported. - We felt
   justified in studying those patients with a low baseline FEV (forced
   expiratory volume in one second), since a subject's bronchial
   response to methacholine remains stable even if these is moderate
   fluctuation both in initial specific airway conductance and in the
   severity of the disease.  We feel that withholding the drug for a
   longer period would not have affected the comparisons.  Although
   there might be a common underlying mechanism in bronchial
   hyperreactivity in asthma and cystic fibrosis, our data showed a
   number of differences between the two groups of patients.  Although
   these differences would not exclude a common mechanism in bronchial
   hyperreactivity in the two diseases, the existence of the differences
   should lead to caution in concluding that there is a common
   underlying mechanism in the bronchial hyperreactivity in the two
   diseases.

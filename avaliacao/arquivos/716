EX We found that the Szczepanski bromide test, which we simplified with
   the aid of ion-sensitive electrode, is suitable for the detection of
   C.F. heterozygosity in most cases.  We examined the sweat of 74
   randomly selected children with respiratory asthma during the past 2
   years, the sodium and chloride concentrations and bromide index being
   determined.  Sodium and chloride concentrations in the sweat of the
   asthma children were slightly but significantly higher (P < 0.05)
   than those of the controls.  The difference in bromide index was even
   more significant (P < 0.01).  This suggests that C.F. gene carriers
   are unusually prevalent among children with bronchial asthma.  One
   possibility is that enhanced ion loss in various diseases with
   allergic pathological mechanisms is secondary in nature.  However,
   this seems unlikely since in our material high sweat-electrolyte
   concentrations were observed in only a proportion of control children
   whose illness was similar in severity to that of the asthmatic
   children, and normal sweat values were obtained even when the child's
   condition was very serious.

EX The nature of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis (C.F.) is
   unknown.  We therefore undertook to study fatty-acid oxidation
   (Beta-oxidation) in patients with C.F.  There was no significant
   difference in the results obtained in controls and either affected
   individuals or heterozygous carriers.  All the values in the
   affected individuals lay within the normal range.  Unless for some
   special reason the defect is not expressed in leukocytes, these
   results indicate that the metabolic pathway involved in fatty-acid
   oxidation (Beta-oxidation) is intact in C.F.  It therefore seems
   unlikely that the reported deficiency of certain essential fatty
   acids in C.F. is the result of a defect in fatty-acid metabolism.

EX Fetal or neonatal volvulus is a rare event and is usually associated
   with an anatomic defect.  Massive abdominal distension secondary to a
   ruptured or unruptured volvulus has never been reported as a cause of
   obstructed labor.  The present report documents such a case,
   secondary to chemical peritonitis resulting from a ruptured midgut
   volvulus.  This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of presumed
   cystic fibrosis with meconium ileus and volvulus which led to
   ischemic infarction and perforation of the small bowel.  This case
   likewise emphasizes the need to consider the presence of other fetal
   anomalies, such as omphalocele or gastroschisis, when the usual
   maneuvers fail to relieve shoulder dystocia.

EX It has been reported that saliva and serum of patients contain
   macromolecular "factors" which are presumably cationic and inhibit
   transport of electrolytes, induce dyskinesis or degranulate
   sensitized polymorphonuclear leukocytes and contain polypeptide
   moieties.  The difference between levels of trypsin-like activity of
   mixed saliva of patients with cystic fibrosis and controls has been
   confirmed.  A number of studies have been carried out in order to
   determine if a deficiency of proteolytic activity might account for
   the presence of cystic fibrosis serum factors.  It was presumed that
   the observed partial deficiency of arginine esterase activity might
   well represent the total deficiency of one of several arginine
   esterases assayed under the experimental conditions.  Although it was
   postulated that the deficiency of arginine esterase activity is
   related to the elevation of the levels of polypeptide or protein
   "factors", the hydrolysis of peptide bands by activated plasma could
   not be demonstrated, probably due to the limitations of the methods
   employed.  The deficiency of plasma arginine esterase in cystic
   fibrosis has been questioned and confirmed in another laboratory.

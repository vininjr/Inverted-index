EX Dr Smalley and her colleagues rightly stress that the commonest
   reason for abnormally high sweat-electrolyte levels, apart from
   cystic fibrosis, is faulty technique.  A further cause of
   false-positive results, and potentially more important than the list
   of rare disorders usually cited, is atopic dermatitis.  Dr M. Ampola
   and I investigated ten children with eczema at the Tufts New England
   Medical Center, Boston, and found higher sodium and/or chloride
   levels in sweat obtained from affected skin than in sweat from normal
   skin in the same individuals.  In four of these atopic children,
   levels within the diagnostic range for cystic fibrosis were obtained
   (above 60 mmol/l).

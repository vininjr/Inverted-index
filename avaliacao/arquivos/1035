AB Sixteen patients with cystic fibrosis were treated with conventional
   physiotherapy aided by an assistant. The results were compared with
   those produced by physiotherapy using the forced expiration technique
   cleared more sputum in less time than conventional physiotherapy. A
   sputum in less time than conventional physiotherapy. A second study
   showed that an assistant did not further improve the results obtained
   by the patient performing the forced expiration technique himself.
   These findings mean that patients with cystic fibrosis who have had
   to rely on the help of others for their home treatment may now
   perform more effective treatment without help. The forced expiration
   technique might also be helpful for patients with chronic bronchitis,
   asthma, or bronchiectasis.

AB The aim of the present study is to elucidate the correlation between
   etiology and histology in nasal polyps with special regard to cystic
   fibrosis (CF). Nasal polyps from 15 children with CF and a control
   group of non-CF polyps from 15 adult patients were examined by light-
   microscopy. The histological evaluation was carried out on a blind
   basis in order to avoid bias. Among the parameters used, the tissue
   eosinophilia proved to be the most valuable factor in the
   differentiation between CF and non-CF polyps, as only few eosinophils
   were found in the CF-polyps. The polyp glands were few and generally
   pathological. Some characteristics abnormalities in the grandular
   morphology are apparently more common in CF polyps. It is concluded,
   that the histological examination of nasal polyps is of importance
   for the correct classification of the patient, but the diagnosis of
   CF cannot be made based on microscopy of polyps. Further studies
   including blinded histological examination of nasal polypous tissue
   might contribute to a more differentiated diagnose of nasal
   polyposis.

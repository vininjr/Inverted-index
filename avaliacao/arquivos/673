AB The oral conditions of 42 patients being treated for cystic fibrosis
   were evaluated. The patients were grouped by age and, in some
   aspects, were compared with a small control group of their siblings.
   The patient group had a lowered incidence of plaque and less gingival
   disease than did the control group in which every person had some
   amount of plaque or gingival disease. Calculus formation was minimal.
   The reasons for the finding of minimal plaque in the patient group
   could be related to several factors, including the life-long use of
   various antibiotic agents, the chewing of digestive enzyme
   supplements, the effect of medical management on tooth hardness, and
   the effect of stained teeth (possible tetracycline deposition) on the
   plaque microorganisms. It appears that the therapy for cystic
   fibrosis was beneficial to the periodontal health of these patients.
   Much further study is needed to understand the interrelationship
   between an altered oral environment (salivary changes in cystic
   fibrosis), altered microbial flora (by antibiotics, enzymes) and even
   altered tooth surfaces (possible tetracycline deposition). Most
   patients were found to have one or more oral habits. Tooth mobility
   was associated with tension habits. Patients who had clubbed fingers
   (indicating pulmonary compromise) and possibly a severe disease
   process, did not appear to have either stained teeth or the severity
   of the gingivitis associated with this. The relationship of
   tetracycline to tooth staining could not be pinpointed.

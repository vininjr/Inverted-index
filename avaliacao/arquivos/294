EX It had been noticed that in cases of cystic fibrosis the palmar skin
   of the fingers and the plantar skin of the toes wrinkled very quickly
   when immersed in water.  Almost without exception, the children with
   cystic fibrosis had noticeable wrinkling of the fingers within 2 min
   of immersion in hand-hot water, whereas normal children showed no (or
   minimal) wrinkling after 10 min.  This wrinkling is due to an excess
   of salt in the skin, which increases water-binding capacity of
   keratin.  The test would thus appear to provide a simple and cheap
   screening method for cystic fibrosis, but one that may not be
   absolutely reliable.

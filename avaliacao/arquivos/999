AB This article describes the first time-limited psychosocial support
   group for adults with cystic fibrosis (CF).The chronology of the
   group is traced, focusing on issues of importance for health
   professionals who work with patients with CF. Some of the issues
   raised by patient members include doubts about the competence of
   nonpediatricians to adequately treat CF; resentment towards "normals"
   (those without CF), including health professionals; and the desire to
   control as many areas of their lives as possible. Covert (ie,
   unrecognized) issues, the role of staff, risks, and outcome are
   detailed as a guide for others who may wish to conduct such groups.
   The literature on groups for medical patients and a rationale for the
   beneficial effects on the group are given.

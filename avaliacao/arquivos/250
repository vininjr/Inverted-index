EX Twenty-six patients with cystic fibrosis all exhibited disease of the
   paranasal sinuses, consisting of opacification of the maxillary
   sinuses either alone or as part of a parasinusitis.  Symptoms of
   sinusitis seldom occurred and treatment was not generally required.
   Agenesis or delayed development of frontal sinuses was also seen in
   the majority of patients.  Nasal polyps occurred in 27% of the
   patients, all of whom were over five years of age.  Excluding those
   patients under five years of age, none of whom had polyps, the
   incidence was 36%.  In general, polyps were not observed in those
   patients with severe disease.  Mild degrees of conductive hearing
   loss were noted in the younger age groups especially, but no
   instance of severe hearing loss or nerve conduction disturbance was
   encountered.  Such mild degrees of hearing loss may merely reflect
   the application of standards too stringent for this age group.
   Throat and nose cultures on 26 patients revealed pseudomonas
   aeruginosa in eighteen cases, reflecting the flora of the
   tracheobronchial tree.  Other organisms were encountered on an
   unpredictable basis with findings consistent with those anticipated
   in this age group of patients.

EX I have diagnosed six cystic fibrosis infants under 1 year of age,
   four of whom had documented episodes of hypoelectrolytemia and severe
   metabolic alkalosis.  These additional data support our previous
   hypothesis that chronic sweat electrolyte depletion, more frequently
   than previously recognized, can cause severe metabolic derangements
   in infants with cystic fibrosis, especially those living in both
   humid and dry, hot climates.

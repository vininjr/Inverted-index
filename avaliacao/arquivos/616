AB A test meal for assessing the intraluminal phase of absorption in
   childhood has been validated. 132 test meals were administered to 110
   patients aged 2 weeks to 18 years (mean age 4.3 years). 10 children
   with suspected malabsorption, who were proven to be normal after
   extensive investigation, constituted the control group. The
   activities of pancreatic enzymes, and the total and individual bile
   salt concentrations are presented for the control subjects, and
   pancreatic enzyme levels in this group are compared with those seen
   in children with pancreatic insufficiency (cystic fibrosis). The test
   meal has been designed so that it can be administered to children
   with suspected gluten, cows' milk, or disaccharide intolerance. The
   control data provided a basis for the interpretation of information
   obtained from the application of such a test meal to the clinical
   investigation of children with suspected malabsorption.

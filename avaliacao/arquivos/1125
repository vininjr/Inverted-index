AB Nineteen nasal polyps from 13 patients were examined histologically.
   Nine polyps from seven cystic fibrosis (CF) patients could be
   positively identified by a triad of observations: delicate, barely
   visible basement membrane of surface epithelium without submucosal
   hyalinization, lack of extensive infiltration of eosinophils (Giemsa
   stains), and a preponderance of acid mucin in glands and cysts of the
   polyp and in its surface mucous blanket (Alcian Blue-periodic acid-
   Schiff stains). Two polyps from two patients with CF and atopy showed
   the characteristic findings of CF without modification. Eight polyps
   from four atopic patients without CF were identified by the reverse
   triad of changes: extensive thickening of the epithelial basement
   membrane and its extension into the submucosa as an irregular hyaline
   membrane, high stromal eosinophil count, and mainly neutral mucin in
   mucous glands, cysts, and mucous blanket. Hyperplastic mucous glands,
   mucous cysts of variable sizes, focal metaplasia of surface
   epithelium, and acid mucin in goblet cells were considered
   nonspecific lesions.

EX We have studied serum-angiotensin-converting-enzyme (SACE) in
   sarcoidosis and other granulomatous disorders.  We have measured SACE
   in 10 randomly chosen, consecutive patients with chronic
   granulomatous disease (CGD) and in some of their family members and
   in 5 children with cystic fibrosis and severe chronic pulmonary
   involvement.  SACE levels in the patient with CGD differed
   significantly from those of normal controls and those of family
   members and patients with cystic fibrosis.  Our preliminary studies
   show that CGD is associated with increased levels of SACE.

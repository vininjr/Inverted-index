EX A key to any successful preventive nutritional program is long-term
   follow up, reinforcement, and early intervention when necessary.  The
   dietitian must evaluate the effectiveness of her approach through
   careful monitoring of various parameters of growth, such as length,
   weight, head circumference, and skinfold measurements.  It is
   essential that she be aware of the advantages, limitations, and
   complications of any dietary program.  We have described only three
   examples of complex nutritional problems encountered in the intensive
   care nursery.  There are many more equally challenging and
   frustrating medical and surgical disorders which demand the expertise
   of the dietitian for successful management.  The dietitian of the
   future cannot rely on knowledge alone, but must utilize considerable
   ingenuity and creativity in managing these complicated nutritional
   enigmas if acceptance and effectiveness are to be maintained.

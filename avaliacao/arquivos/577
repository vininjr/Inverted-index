AB Immunoglobulin levels and precipitating antibody against a range of
   microbial antigens were measured in simultaneously collected serum
   and sputum samples from patients with chronic bronchitis (11), cystic
   fibrosis (9), bronchiectasis (9), and asthma (4). Sputum was prepared
   by dialysis and high-speed centrifugation methods. Results showed
   that it was possible to detect precipitating antibody in the sputum,
   and the rate was increased when both methods were used. A discrepancy
   was noted between the detection rate in the sputum and serum. This,
   combined with the lack of correlation between sputum and serum
   immunoglobulins, lack of relationship between bronchial inflammation
   and sputum immunoglobulins, and the lack of IgM in the sputum
   suggested that the antibody and immunoglobulin were locally produced.
   Sputum IgA (7S) in patients with chronic bronchitis was significantly
   lower (P less than 0-05) than that found in patients with cystic
   fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Significant differences (P less than 0-
   05) were also noted in serum IgG levels between patients with chronic
   bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis while serum IgM
   levels in patients with chronic bronchitis were significantly lower
   (P less than 0-05) when compared to serum levels in patients with
   cystic fibrosis. The presence of precipitating antibody in the sputum
   raises the possibility that type III reactions may be important in
   the pathogenesis of these conditions.

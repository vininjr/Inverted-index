AB Responses to treadmill exercise of 36 patients with cystic fibrosis
   were studied to evaluate their usefulness in identifying those with
   atopy. Ten of 36 patients with cystic fibrosis (28%) had an abnormal
   response to exercise but had no more frequent atopic characteristics
   than those who had normal exercise responses. Response to treadmill
   exercise alone cannot identify patients with atopic disease among
   those with cystic fibrosis.

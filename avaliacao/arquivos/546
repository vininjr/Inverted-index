AB Examined in this study are the immediate effects of bronchial
   drainage preceded by the inhalation of aerosol solutions of a
   mucolytic agent, a bronchodilator, and their combination upon four
   measures of pulmonary function in 20 patients with cystic fibrosis.
   On three separate occasions, pulmonary function was tested preceding
   and following treatments consisting of one of the above three aerosol
   solutions followed by bronchial drainage. The order of solutions used
   was random and each subject received one treatment with each
   solution. The greatest overall improvement in function was seen with
   the bronchodilator and bronchial drainage. The combination of the
   bronchodilator/mucolytic agents and bronchial drainage was the next
   most effective technique. The mucolytic agent, when used alone with
   bronchial drainage, decreased function. Comparison of the pulmonary
   function scores indicated a significant difference among the three
   treatments.

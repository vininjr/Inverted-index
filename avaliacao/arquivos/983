AB Serum from normal persons and from 133 cystic fibrosis patients was
   examined for precipitins against faecal bacteria (E. coli and B.
   fragilis) and against P. aeruginosa by means of crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis.  27% of the normal sera contained 1-2
   precipitins against E. coli, 16% contained one precipitin against B.
   fragilis and 6% contained one precipitin against P. aeruginosa.  In
   sera from cystic fibrosis patients, there was a significantly
   increased prevalence of precipitins against E. coli (76%), B.
   fragilis (38%) and P. aeruginosa (63%), and the mean number of
   precipitins against each of these bacteria was 3 (range: 1-12), 1.4
   (range: 1-4), and 16 (range: 1-60), respectively.  Increased numbers
   of precipitins against P. aeruginosa were correlated with chronic
   lung infection caused by this species and with poor prognosis,
   whereas such associations were not revealed as regards precipitins
   against the two other bacterial species.  Increased numbers of
   precipitins against E. coli and B. fragilis were significantly
   associated with increased numbers of precipitins against P.
   aeruginosa.  It is suggested that this association is due to immune
   reactions in the intestinal mucosa, resulting in increased
   absorption of antigens from the gut.

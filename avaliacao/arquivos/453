AB Although similar fractions of cells were in the S phase of the cell
   cycle, normal human skin fibroblasts were shown to incorporate more
   than twice the 3HTdR into their DNA in vitro than did cells obtained
   from individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Obligate heterozygotes
   incorporated an intermediate amount of the DNA precursor. Studied
   were initiated to determine the basis of the differential
   incorporation of 3HTdR among the genotypes. An analog of thymidine,
   BUdR, produced varied effects on the growth kinetics of the three
   genotypes. The growth of cells in BUdR resulted in a 50% increase in
   the population doubling times of all three genotypes, and caused the
   cell morphology to change from a spindle shape to one in which the
   cells became broadened and flat, with numerous cytoplasmic
   projections extending for distances of several cell diameters. The
   activities of thymidine kinase and the participation of the exogenous
   and de novo pathways in the synthesis of TMP were found to be
   approximately the same in all three genotypes. The data suggest that
   an alteration in the transport of thymidine into the cells may
   account for the differences in TdR incorporation into DNA, and this
   may be associated with other changes in cystic fibrosis that are
   apparently membrane associated.

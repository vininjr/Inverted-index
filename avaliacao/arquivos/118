EX We have reported that red-cell glutathione reductase (G.R.)
   activity is increased in cystic-fibrosis (C.F.) patients in
   comparison with age and sex matched controls.  We have also
   demonstrated that serum-G.R. activity is significantly greater in
   C.F. than in controls, obligate heterozygotes, and patients with a
   variety of respiratory and immunological diseases.  Moreover,
   serum-G.R. from C.F. patients and carriers responds differently
   from controls after storage or incubation with heparin.  We have
   now examined G.R. in white blood-cells (W.B.C.) of C.F. patients.
   The day after collection of samples mean W.B.C.-G.R. activity was
   significantly less in the C.F. group than in carriers and controls.
   No differences in G.R. activity between the groups was apparent
   after 4 and 6 days.  White-cell G.R. activity apparently is lower
   in C.F. patients than in controls.  We cannot rationalise this
   decrease with the increased activity found in C.F. red cells and
   serum.  Nevertheless, the differences between C.F. and controls are
   of greater interest than the apparent directional contradiction.
   The basis for quantatitive enzyme differences is very difficult to
   determine.  The simplest explanation is that the initial white-cell
   G.R. differences between C.F. patients on the one hand and controls
   and carriers on the other are secondary to some aspect of the
   disease or its treatment; but there is no evidence to support such
   a conclusion.  These results, which reflect altered behaviour of
   G.R. from C.F. patients, suggest to us that G.R. is involved in
   C.F.

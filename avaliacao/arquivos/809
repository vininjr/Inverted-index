AB One-hour blood-xylose concentrations after an oral xylose load were
   measured in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and healthy controls.
   The mean of the 1-hour blood-xylose values was significantly
   increased in the group with CF. The finding confirms an earlier
   observation by Rolles et al. (1973). Its significance is not at
   present understood but it suggests that small intestinal function
   should be further investigated in CF.

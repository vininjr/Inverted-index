EX The search for the basic defect in cystic fibrosis has so far been
   singularly disappointing.  There is no doubt that it is a disease
   recessively inherited, ie that the parents carry the cystic fibrosis
   gene without showing any signs of ill health (heterozygous) but when
   transmitted from both of them to an offspring this child manifests
   the disease, having acquired the abnormal gene in double dose
   (homozygote).  Cystic fibrosis is the most common of the genetically
   determined diseases.  Two types of cultured cells, fibroblasts and
   white cells from affected individuals and heterozygous carriers for
   cystic fibrosis, showed characteristic changes of metachromasia that
   seemed to allow for a classification of patients and carriers to be
   distributed into separate classes.  Serum from patients with cystic
   fibrosis of the pancreas disorganises the movement of cilia of the
   isolated rabbit tracheal mucosa.  One of the early and also most
   constant observations is the 'viscosity' of secretions of the mucosal
   glands in the respiratory tract, in the alimentary apparatus, in the
   biliary system and in the pancreas.  A striking increase in the
   levels of sodium and chloride, and to a lesser extent of potassium,
   is present in the sweat of practically all sufferers of cystic
   fibrosis.  However frustrating and tantalising the outcome of
   research into the basic defect has been so far, the ultimate answer
   is likely to be astonishing in it simplicity.

EX Cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disorder, remains the most
   common lethal genetic disease of Caucasian people.  The diagnosis of
   CF is usually made based upon the clinical presentation of chronic
   respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, a positive sweat
   electrolyte test and, often, a family history of the disorder.  The
   manifestations of chronic cough, recurrent pneumonias, bronchiectasis
   with clubbing, pneumothorax, hemoptysis, and malabsorption secondary
   to pancreatic insufficiency are so well associated with cystic
   fibrosis that the diagnosis is usually not delayed.  However, it is
   often not appreciated by physicians that CF may be associated with a
   broad spectrum of less common manifestations as well as extreme
   variability in severity of illness.  Lack of familiarity with these
   manifestations may delay diagnosis until adolescence or adulthood.
   First, there seems to be mild clinical expression of the disorder in
   some patients (genetic variability).  Second, the subtle
   manifestations of CF are not widely appreciated by physicians in
   practice.

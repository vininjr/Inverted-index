EX The water-binding capacity of a protein is minimal at its
   isoelectric point (pH 3.5 - 5 for the keratins making up the horny
   layers) and increases with increasing divergence from the
   isoelectric point.  It is for this reason that normal palmar skin
   wrinkles after moderate immersion in warm water, especially if it
   is soapy (pH 8 or more).  However, in patients with cystic fibrosis
   it is the increased salt content of the sweat rather than the pH
   difference which increases the water-binding capacity of the
   keratin, and is responsible for the wrinkling in these patients.

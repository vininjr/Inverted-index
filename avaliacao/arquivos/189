EX A nurse and mother describes the clinical effects of cystic fibrosis
   on patients and the long-term demands the disease places on her own
   and other children and families.  Diagnosis is mainly accomplished
   with an analysis of sweat for sodium and chloride ions.  CF is
   transmitted as a Mendelian recessive trait.  It is a generalized
   dysfunction of the endocrine glands.  The abnormalities, seemingly
   unrelated, appear as loss of electrolytes through the sweat and
   salivary glands and as unusually thick, sticky mucus secretions that
   obstruct and damage the patient's pancreas, lungs, gallbladder,
   intestines, and liver.  The objective of pulmonary therapy are to
   decrease viscosity of the pulmonary secretions and to improve and
   maintain pulmonary hygiene.  Financial cost is only one of many
   burdens on the family.

AB The diseases of respiratory system are nowadays one of the important
   medical, economical and social problems of modern civilization. A
   common symptom of these diseases regardless of their etiology,
   character, klinical manifestation and morphological findings is
   hypersecretion of bronchial sputum. Tracheobronchial mucus is
   produced by mucous bronchial glands and goblet cells. This mucus
   represents at physiological condition about 5 micrometer thick cover
   on mucous of nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi up to terminal
   bronchioles. Protective function of mucus cover resposes in
   mechanical and humoral barrier and also in removing the inhaled
   particles and their transport to the upper part of the respiratory
   system. In spite of the fact, that bronchial secretion has an
   important role in protective mechanism and in thermal and water
   exchange of respiratory tract, this secretion is not sufficiently
   scrutinized mainly of children yet.

AB In our hands, the BMC-Test Meconium has been a significant step
   towards the goal of developing an ideal newborn screening test for
   CF. It is easily performed, is highly specific, has reasonably high
   sensitivity, and--given its limitation of identifying only patients
   with CF who have intrauterine pancreatic insufficiency--is the best
   method of screening newborns for CF that has been devised to date.
   Many technical problems remain to be solved before the test can be
   endorsed without reservation. Because the test, as currently
   constituted, does not identify all potential subjects for further
   testing who might have CF, it should not be made mandatory. It is,
   however, better than other available screening methods for CF and can
   be praised for that benefit. The concept has indicated a valuable new
   direction for mass-screening possibilities and perhaps can, by future
   modification, be made sensitive enough to warrant universal usage.

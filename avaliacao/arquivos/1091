EX Cystic fibrosis is currently the most common fatal hereditary disease
   of the Caucasian race.  The lack of effective oral antibiotics
   against Pseudomonas aeruginosa precludes either systemic treatment or
   suppression, in an outpatient setting, of the chronic pseudomonas
   bronchitis typically seen in CF patients.  Because of the central
   role of infection, and particularly pseudomonas infection, in the
   sequence of events that leads to respiratory failure and death in CF,
   currently available information regarding the pathogenesis of
   infections caused by P. aeruginosa was emphasized and discussed at a
   workshop on infections in patients with CF, sponsored by the National
   Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., on
   January 9 and 10, 1979.

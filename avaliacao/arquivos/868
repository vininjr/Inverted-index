AB A method for estimating a 'heparin binding capacity' of human serum
   is described. When human serum is diluted with a low ionic strength,
   heparin-containing buffer at pH 5.5, protein-heparin electrostatic
   complexes form in solution with subsequent formation of insoluble
   aggregates which can be collected by centrifugation. Quantitative
   determination of the relative amounts by weight of protein and
   heparin in the insoluble heparin-protein aggregates permits
   estimation of a combining ratio at which serum proteins bind with
   heparin to precipitate from solution. This weight combining ratio of
   protein and heparin is a quantitative measure of the total affinity
   for heparin of all proteins in serum which bind heparin at pH 5.57 to
   form an insoluble complex. An unusually high affinity for heparin by
   an abnormal serum protein or an increase in amount of a normally-
   occuring, high heparin-affinity, serum protein would alter the
   average protein: heparin combining ratio and increase the 'heparin-
   binding capacity' of human serum. The converse would be true for
   serum proteins having a low affinity for heparin, lowering the
   'heparin-binding capacity' of human serum. The described method was
   used to evaluate the 'heparin-binding capacity' of serum proteins in
   normal individuals and in persons with cystic fibrosis.

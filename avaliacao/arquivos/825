AB Sweat tests collected on two or more occasions from normal children
   and children with cystic fibrosis have been analysed according to
   the weight of sweat collected.  In five cases collections of 50-99
   mg of sweat gave false negative results.  Although 50-100 mg of
   sweat is considered adequate by some authorities our results do not
   support this.  The study confirms the view that at least 100 mg of
   sweat must be collected to give reliable results.

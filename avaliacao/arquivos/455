AB Caries prevalence, oral hygiene index, submandibular gland
   hypertrophy, occlusion, dental hypoplasia, and staining of permanent
   teeth were evaluated in 63 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who
   were maintained on a regimen of broad-spectrum antibiotics and oral
   pancreatin, and the findings were compared with those of their near-
   aged siblings. Gland hypertrophy and dental staining were increased
   in patients with CF whereas caries was significantly decreased. No
   other significant differences were found.

AB The short circuit current rat jejunum bioassay, first employed in an
   attempt to discern the cystic fibrosis (CF) serum "factor," was
   evaluated using sera from patients with pancreatic disease.  The
   data suggest other pancreatic diseases, specifically genetic
   diabetes and alcoholic pancreatitis, also present with a serum
   "factor" (or "factors") which reduce the short circuit current of
   rat jejunum, an effect very similar to that of the CF serum
   "factor."  A large number of sera from presumed normal subjects also
   exhibited a significant reduction in short circuit current; these
   (false positives) represent a yet to be defined mechanism, however,
   they do decrease the likelihood that the observed effect is merely
   due to pancreatic destruction.  Detailed procedure and equipment
   specifications for the bioassay system are included.

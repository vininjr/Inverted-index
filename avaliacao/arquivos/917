AB IgE antibody production to exoenzymes and common antigen (OEP) of P.
   aeruginosa was studied in mice that were injected with the antigens
   incorporated into water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsion or Al(OH)3
   gel. OEP and protease toxoid (PT) elicited IgE antibody response but
   elastase toxoid (ET) did not. Capacity of the OEP to produce IgE
   antibody was reduced remarkably by it's protease treatment, which
   suggested that the capacity lies in the protein portion of OEP. The
   w/o/w emulsion was less effective than Al(OH)3 gel in adjuvanticity
   to elicit IgE antibody response, but the emulsion enhanced the IgM
   and/or IgG antibody response to PT and maintained a constant level
   for a long period. These findings may suggest that IgE antibody
   response to some components of P. aeruginosa could be induced in man.
   High serum level of IgE was observed in some cases of cystic fibrosis
   caused by P. aeruginosa infection, although the IgE antibody activity
   has not yet been determined.

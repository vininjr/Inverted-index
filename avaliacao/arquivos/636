AB Culture medium from fibroblasts of cystic fibrosis patients and
   controls was examined for the ability to inhibit (calcium plus
   magnesium)-activated ATPase and (sodium plus potassium)-activated
   ATPase. The ATPase systems used were both a solubilised preparation
   from dog-fish and a membrane associated preparation from human
   erythrocyes. Contrary to other reports the medium from cystic
   fibrosis fibroblasts did not inhibit ATPase activity.

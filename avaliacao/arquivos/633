AB The incorporation of fucose to glycoprotein acceptors prepared from
   the saliva of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients was compared with the
   incorporation into acceptors from controls. The CF acceptor
   glycoprotein incorporated significantly more fucose in the presence
   of either patients' or control plasma. The fucosyl transferase
   activity in the patients' plasma was not significantly different from
   controls. Fucosidase activity was similar also for both groups. The
   protein bands of the acceptor glycoproteins from the patients' saliva
   differed from those of the control in number and electrophoretic
   mobility. On the basis of these studies of fucose incorporation we
   propose that glycoprotein in the salivary secretion of E&Apatients
   are qualitatively different from normal.

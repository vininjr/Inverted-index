EX We have observed severe meconium plug syndrome (MPS) in a newborn
   infant who was found during the neonatal period to have extensive
   exocrine pancreatic deficiency.  Cystic fibrosis was excluded by
   several sweat chloride tests.  Our observation of MPS in a patient
   with exocrine pancreatic deficiency suggests that the MPS observed in
   the CF patients reported by Rosenstein is probably caused by
   pancreatic deficiency.  The frequent occurrence of meconium ileus
   (MI) in CF and the rarity of MPS in CF is curious, since they may be
   different manifestations of the same pathologic process.
   Conceivably, MPS may occur with total absence of pancreatic enzymes
   (as in our patient and in a few patients with CF).  Low levels of
   enzymes in CF may limit expression to meconium ileus.  We wish to
   suggest the evaluation of exocrine pancreatic function in these
   patients even if CF has been excluded by sweat tests. - There is
   conflicting, albeit fragmentary, data suggesting that exocrine
   pancreatic deficiency may not be the sole cause of meconium
   obstruction in CF.  Several investigators have suggested that MI may
   be the result of abnormal protein and mucoprotein secretions by the
   intestinal goblet cells and not from lack of pancreatic enzymes
   alone.  While these observations suggest that exocrine pancreatic
   deficiency may not play a major role in all instance of meconium
   obstruction, it is important to note that there may be little
   correlation between the histologic appearance of the pancreas and
   exocrine function.

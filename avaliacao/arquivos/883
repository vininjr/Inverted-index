AB Children with cystic fibrosis have skeletal maturation and epiphyseal
   anomalies similar to those in children with nutritional problems.
   However, these patients have been found to have normal somatic
   development if treatment is begun early. In a group of children with
   cystic fibrosis undergoing medical treatment, cephalometric
   measurements compared favorably with those established by normal
   standards.

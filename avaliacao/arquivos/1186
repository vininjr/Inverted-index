EX Making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis requires clinical suspicion
   and sweat tests.  Physicians today are aware of the main clinical
   features of pulmonary and pancreatic involvement and are suspecting
   the diagnosis earlier than in past years.  The accuracy of the sweat
   test is the most crucial factor in confirming the diagnosis.  The
   present case illustrates this point.  The main purpose of this paper
   is to serve as a reminder that the sweat test is often less than
   accurate as frequently performed.  The principal pitfall of sweat
   testing at present seems to be the use of a chloride electrode
   applied to the skin without assurance that an adequate amount of
   sweat is present.

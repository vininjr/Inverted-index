EX The purpose of this communication is to review our experiences with
   children with cystic fibrosis seen from January 1964 to January 1975
   and to analyse the factors which have contributed to the improved
   prognosis which has occurred in this period.  The numbers of new
   patients have increased from six in 1964 to 12 in 1974.  Both sexes
   have been equally affected.  Respiratory infections, failure to
   thrive and diarrhoea were the predominant presenting features in that
   order, and thus any one of these presenting features should indicate
   that cystic fibrosis should at least be considered and excluded.
   Each patient was assessed monthly at the clinic during which
   attendance formal physiotherapy was carried out and the parents were
   instructed in the techniques of percussion and drainage.  Forty-two
   of our sixty-four patients are still alive and thirty-three of those
   fall into the excellent category, seven into the good and one each
   into the fair and poor.  During the period of this review there has
   been an obvious improvement with a fall in morbidity and mortality
   and with the increasing proportion of patients now in the "excellent"
   group.  We attribute these facts to earlier diagnosis, regular and
   careful follow-up and a supervised therapeutic programme including
   parent education and participation.  It would seem, therefore, that
   early diagnosis and active treatment prolong life and give better
   health.

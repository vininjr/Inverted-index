EX Duke Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health have
   analyzed the maximum achieved heights and weights of 60 persons with
   CF over 20 years old.  Both parameters were markedly skewed toward
   the lower percentile bands.  No significant differences were found
   among patients whose condition was diagnosed early in life, in those
   with more severe pulmonary or gastrointestinal impairment, or among
   those in whom pancreatic enzyme and/or nutritional supplementation
   had been employed.  Nutritional supplementation has yet to be proven
   a significant long-term influence on the morbidity or mortality of
   CF. - Lober reported data on 60 persons with cystic fibrosis (CF)
   over 20 years of age, while our population of 63 individuals
   contained only three who were over 15 years old.  The median age of
   death in patients with CF is 12 years.  It is not realistic to
   compare patients who have survived to adulthood with a younger
   group.  He did not state the type of nutritional supplementation
   that was of no significance among his patients.  Our experience with
   nutritional supplements other than the amino acid-glucose polymer
   mixture has been equally poor.  Our data on growth rates were
   similar to those of Lober in that both heights and weights were
   skewed toward the lower end, and height was less affected than
   weight.  Increased rates of linear growth were observed in eight of
   13 children under 12 years of age at the time the dietary supplement
   was begun.  Patients who continue to take the nutritional supplement
   have not shown further deterioration in pulmonary status.

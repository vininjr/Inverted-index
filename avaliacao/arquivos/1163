EX We decided to survey a geographically defined population of cystic
   fibrosis patients and parents living in Avon County, England.  By
   examining the obligate heterozygotes (the parents), we would be able
   to assess the influence of the CF gene without the presence of the
   disease.  There is an increase in immediate hypersensitivity to A.
   fumigatus in CF patients but not their parents.  This increased
   sensitivity is probably IgE-mediated and a secondary effect of lung
   damage.  There is no evidence that the CF gene produces a generalised
   increase in skin reactivity (atopy), serum IgE or serum IgG4 in the
   heterozygotes.  They are not therefore likely to develop asthma.

AB In a survey of cystic fibrosis (CF) in the Avon area, 48 children
   with CF from 40 families together with 71 of their parents were
   studied by spirometry, exercise tests, and pinch tests. A control
   group of 42 young adults was similarly tested; control data for
   children were taken from previously published work. The prevalence of
   atopy (any positive prick test) in children with CF was 48%.
   Sensitivity to grass pollens and house dust mite was no more common
   in these children (29%) than in a normal population (34%).
   Hypersensitivity to Aspergillus fumigatus was found in 35% of
   children with CF and was associated with severe lung disease. The
   parents had a normal pattern and prevalence of atopy. Exercise-
   induced airways obstruction was present in only 22% of children with
   CF; its association with severe lung disease rendered interpretation
   difficult. The parents had a normal response to exercise. Both
   hypersensitivity to A. fumigatus and exercise-induced airways
   lability had the features of acquired characteristics. There was
   nothing in the present study to support the hypothesis that the
   possession of a CF gene predisposed to atopy.

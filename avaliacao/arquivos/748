   ULTRAFILTRATION.
AB Purified serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), derived from eight cystic
   fibrosis (CF) and five carrier subjects, has been shown to be
   responsible for the mucociliary disturbances noted in the rabbit
   tracheal bioassay. A small molecular substance of less than 10,000
   but greater than 1,000 daltons (by Amicon filtration) was found
   associated with gamma-globulin fractions isolated from sera of these
   same cystic patients and their parents. Once separated by PM-10
   ultrafiltration, this small substance was unable to promote the
   ciliary dyskinesia response in eight of eight CF and five of five CF
   carrier individuals unless pooled purified human IgG was added. In
   addition, the IgG-rich fraction retained by PM-10 ultrafiltration was
   still able to promote the ciliary dyskinesia response in the
   bioassay, an event noted in our earlier work with whole serum. The
   size of the small serum substance and its association with IgG
   closely corresponds to that described for the oyster test system, as
   well as to that produced by cultured cells derived from homozygotes
   and heteroxygotes for this genetic disorder. The persistence of the
   ability to promote mucociliary disturbances by the IgG-rich retentate
   PM-10 fractions may be indicative of the ineffective molecular
   separation by the Amicon ultransfiltration apparatus or may represent
   another CF-related, IgG-associated substance not influenced by
   ultrafiltration. Speculation The genetic disturbance of CF can be
   explained by the presence of a molecule(s) which has an affinity for
   IgG, which in turn gives rise to the various physiologic facets of
   this disorder. This molecule(s) is present in CF only because of a
   deficiency of an enzyme which normally controls its level by
   inactivation.

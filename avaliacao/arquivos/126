EX The nature of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) has, to
   date, not been elucidated.  Elliott reported that intravenous
   administration of soybean oil and lecithin to children suffering
   from CF caused their sweat sodium concentration to decrease towards
   normal values.  This prompted us to investigate the fatty acid
   spectra of the various serum lipid classes of children with CF.  We
   have found that affected children are deficient in essential fatty
   acids.  The data suggest another approach to the study of the
   metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis.  There is an apparent
   deficiency in essential fatty acids, and a marked reduction in
   serum vitamin E levels has also been reported in CF.  These
   conditions might be partially corrected by intravenous injection,
   or possibly feeding of, lipids containing essential fatty acids
   with concomitant administration of vitamin E.  The observed
   deficiency in essential fatty acids may be produced by a reduced
   ability to absorb these acids from the diet and this, in turn, may
   result in defects in membrane structure or stability.  Reduced
   levels of vitamin E in CF may reflect a reduced requirement for
   this vitamin because of the lower levels of essential fatty acids.
   It is also possible that the observed deficiency in serum levels of
   essential fatty acids may lead to less than normal production of
   prostaglandins.

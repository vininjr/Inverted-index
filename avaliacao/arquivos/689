EX The possibility has been raised that complement plays a role in the
   pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF).  This impairment would be
   consistent with the thesis that the alternative pathway had been
   activated in vivo and, therefore, depleted.  The purpose of this work
   is to explore further the function of the alternative pathway in
   cystic fibrosis.  Examination of the data using Student's t test and
   analysis of variance showed no significant difference in the mean
   hemolytic activity of sera of CF patients as compared to the control
   group.  The data presented do not support the work of Polley and
   Bearn who demonstrated an abnormality in CF patients using conversion
   of C3 by inulin as assay.  The reason for this discrepancy is not
   clear.  Our results do not preclude in vivo activation of the
   alternative pathway, since a compensatory increase in synthesis of
   components could offset component consumption.  Since the net result
   is a completely normal level of activity, however, it does not seem
   likely that significant consumption has occurred.

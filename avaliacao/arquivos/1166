EX Drift, chance effect in a small community and consanguinity have
   resulted in South West Africa's high cystic fibrosis incidence.
   Isolated communities generations ago in Europe, e.g. Bad Gastein,
   where this congress was held, surrounded by its Alpine peaks, could
   have resulted in gene enrichment, which together with the increased
   fertility of the heterozygote could still be responsible for most of
   the CF seen wherever Europeans live today.

EX Well children show a steady increase of staphylococcal precipitins
   throughout life.  Lower incidences are found for precipitins against
   H. influenzae, Pneumococcus, and haemolytic streptococcus.
   Precipitins against Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Klibsiella are rare.
   There are marked differences between the normal children and the
   cloxacillin-treated children with cystic fibrosis in respect to
   Pseudomonas and H. influenzae which rise to over 50% of cystic
   fibrosis children in the third quinquennium.  However, the
   development of staphylococcal precipitins can be prevented by
   continuous antistaphylococcal therapy.

AB 111 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), aged 7 months to 29 years,
   were examined to detect inflammatory middle ear diseases. 35% had a
   history of one or more attacks of acute otitis media, an incidence at
   the same level as in non-CF patients. None had chronic suppurative
   otitis. Only 4 out of the 88 patients able to cooperate in audiometry
   had a hearing impairment. In 2, the hearing loss was perceptive, in 3
   very mild, and in the fourth case, moderately severe. The middle ear
   pressure was measured in 108 patients, in 86 of whom it proved
   normal. In 15 patients the middle ear pressure was lower than--100
   mmH2O, indicating tubal occlusion, and in 7 patients the impedance
   minimum was lacking, indicating an accumulation of mucus. These 7
   patients (6%) had secretory otitis media. Nasal polyps were or had
   been present in 32%. There was no correlation between nasal polyps
   and tubal occlusion or secretory otitis. The incidence of
   inflammatory middle ear diseases in CF patients was in the same range
   as in non-CF patients, a finding at variance with some previous
   investigations showing middle ear pathology in 25--48%.

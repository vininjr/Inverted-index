EX A four year old Chinese girl of parents who emigrated to Singapore
   from South China was found to be suffering from bronchiectasis as a
   result of repeated chest infections, and failure to thrive.
   Investigations confirmed the bronchiectasis, and, in the course of
   attempting to elucidate the course, sweat Cl and sweat Na were found
   to be raised.  The patient occasionally passed soft bulky stools and
   the Vitamin A absorption test was abnormal.  The pathogenesis,
   problems in diagnosis and the genetics are briefly reviewed.  This is
   the first proved case of cystic fibrosis occurring in a child of pure
   Chinese stock, and the first to be described in South-East Asia.
   Cystic fibrosis occurring in non-Caucasians in reviewed.

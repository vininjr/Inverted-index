AB The force of impact and frequency of percussion by physiotherapists
   and parents of children with cystic fibrosis were analysed on a
   special test rig and incorporated in a prototype percussor. In adult
   volunteers and cadavers a maximum intrathoracic pressure could be
   achieved by a critical frequency of mechanical percussion which was
   higher than that reached by physiotherapists and parents.
   Consequently the percussor was redesigned to operate at this optimum
   frequency. It was then discovered that if the percussor was pressed
   firmly enough against the chest, this maximum intrathoracic pressure
   could be indicated by quivering of the voice. In a continuing study
   of intrathoracic pressures obtained mechanically and manually the
   Salford percussor's produced higher pressures than the
   physiotherapists' and maintained them constantly, while the
   physiotherapists' efforts and results varied from one to another.
   Hospital and domiciliary use of the percussor have shown it to help
   in the first stage of the physiotherapy routine for patients with
   cystic fibrosis. The percussor should enable adolescents and adults
   to treat themselves and encourage twice-daily and more effective
   chest treatments. It is easy to apply and its speed and efficiency
   should enable parents to improve the quality of their chest therapy
   for younger children at home. Its long-term benefits are difficult to
   assess because of the nature of the disease.

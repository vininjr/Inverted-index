EX Roller and Kern report that bile acid malabsorption in patients with
   cystic fibrosis (CF) and acquired pancreatic insufficiency is
   minimal.  These findings are at variance with other studies and
   deserve comment.  In the absence of fecal bile acid values in
   controls, the authors cannot state that levels in CF are only twice
   normal values, especially since the papers cited on normal bile acid
   excretion refer to measurements obtained by a different technique.
   We also question the validity of the breath test as an index of bile
   acid malabsorption in CF.  Our recent report shows that in 8 older CF
   (mean age 12.1 years) the magnitude of bile acid loss in the stools
   was comparable to that of the younger age group (mean age 3.9 years)
   and that there was no correlation between the age and the degree of
   bile acid loss.  On the other hand, we must take issue with Roller
   and Kern when they suggest that bile acid malabsorption in CF is
   probably not clinically important.  Our findings not only bear
   relevance to the intestinal manifestations of CF and to the increased
   incidence of cholelithiasis but perhaps also to the early deposition
   within the intrahepatic ducts of eosinophilic mucus concretions
   proposed as the cause of biliary cirrhosis in this disease.

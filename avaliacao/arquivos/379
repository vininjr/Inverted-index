AB A new technique of measuring stool enzyme activity on dry specimens
   of faeces from newborn children at 4-5 days of age has detected 3
   cases of cystic fibrosis in the first 6000 tests. No known cases of
   cystic fibrosis have been missed. Additionally, one case of
   pancreatic achylia of at least 4 months' duration has been detected.
   It is proposed that the detection of cystic fibrosis by this
   technique is sufficiently practical to be acceptable as a worthwhile
   newborn screening programme. The screening test has been in use in
   Auckland for over a year and is now being set up in Hamilton,
   Wellington, and Dunedin (New Zealand), and Sydney (Australia).

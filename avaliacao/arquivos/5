AB The capacity of duodenal juice to hydrolyse casein to
   trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptides was investigated: in a control
   group (11 infants and children and 7 adults); in 5 children with
   pancreatic disease; in 10 children with enterogenic malabsorption
   (coeliac disease and cow's milk protein intolerance).  The
   proteolytic activity per ml duodenal juice in fasting condition was
   as great in healthy infants and children as healthy adults (500-600
   mg casein/ml/hour).  There was a good correlation between trypsin
   content and proteolytic activity of duodenal juice.  In pancreatic
   insufficiency, the proteolytic activity was extremely low (not
   measurable in 3 patients) as was the trypsin activity whereas in
   enterogenic malabsorption, it was within the ranges of the controls.

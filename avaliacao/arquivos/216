EX Professor R. K. Chandra and others suggest that estimation of serum
   alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) might help in detecting carriers in families
   at risk for cystic fibrosis.  Observers in the U.K. have been unable
   to confirm these findings, whereas Dr. J. A. Smith of New York
   supports them.  Perhaps the crux of the matter lies in the technique
   of estimating serum AFP.  if a small number of families is analysed
   the proportion of affected individuals may differ from the expected.
   By chance some families may have all normal children whereas some
   may have all affected children.  For example, nowadays, since
   families tend to be small, the appearance of an autosomal recessive
   condition is often sporadic with only one affected person in the
   family.  This could well apply to cystic fibrosis.

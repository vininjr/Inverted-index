EX From 1971 to 1973, we hospitalized 41 symptomatic patients with
   cystic fibrosis for intensive pulmonary therapy.  The more severely
   ill patients were admitted more than once during this period.  Our
   study included 100 courses of such intensive treatment.  Garamycin
   pediatric injectable, containing 10 mg/ml of the active ingredient,
   was administered intravenously to all patients in divided doses of
   3.0 to 5.0 mg/kg/day.  The purpose of the study was to evaluate the
   tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of garamycin when
   administered parenterally to cystic fibrosis patients with serious
   infections.  During the 100 courses of treatment, clinical
   improvement was rated as follows: significant or definite
   improvement, 39; moderate improvement, 50; slight improvement, 9; and
   no change, 2.  The use of garamycin pediatric injectable is safe and
   can be helpful in the management of the pulmonary infectious
   complications of cystic fibrosis when employed along with other
   well-established modalities of therapy.

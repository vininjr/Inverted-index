AB In 87 patients with svere chronic asthma, the sweat chloride (Cl)
   level was determined, and increased concentrations were found in 12
   (13.7%).  In 76% of the relatives of these patients increased sweat
   Cl levels were also found.  The authors give data of their clinical
   and allergy study and conclude that 13.7% of the patients under
   investigation had clinical characteristics of asthma, allergy and a
   functional exocrine disorder.  The exocrinopathy may be an important
   factor in the pathophysiology of certain types of asthma.

EX Assessment of the status of circulating vitamin D in cystic fibrosis
   patients was investigated by determining serum levels of
   25-hydroxycholecalciferol.  The majority of the patients with CF and
   pancreatic insufficiency had levels of 25-OH-D within the normal
   range.  Clinical symptoms or pathologic signs resulting from
   deficiencies of vitamins A and E in patients with CF have been
   repeatedly documented.  In contrast, a paradoxical lack of vitamin D
   deficiency signs has been observed in CF patients.  This is
   especially puzzling since rickets had been commonly associated with
   most other forms of steatorrhea.  We can only speculate why rickets
   was formerly rarely reported in association with CF.  Perhaps because
   of voracious appetites and the selective absorption of vitamin D via
   the lymphatics without requiring esterification, these individuals
   were spared clinical rickets.

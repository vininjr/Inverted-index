EX All of us who care for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are well
   aware of the varying degrees of clinical involvement they have.  It
   has long been known that whereas the most patients have pulmonary
   involvement of one degree or another, approximately 15% to 20% of
   patients will not have any pancreatic involvement.  In the 80% to 85%
   of patients with pancreatic involvement, the degree of involvement
   can vary greatly.  If we can accept the concept of clinical
   heterogeneity for the pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems, there
   is no reason why we should doubt the existence of clinical
   variability for the other major organ system affected by this
   disease, the sweat glands.

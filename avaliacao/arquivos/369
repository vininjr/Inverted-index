AB The incidence of serum IgE antibodies to several species of
   aspergillus and the incidence of serum precipitins to these species
   and to Candida albicans were determined in 22 children with cystic
   fibrosis, 17 children with bronchial asthma, and 18 control subjects.
   IgE antibodies were found in 50 per cent of the patients with cystic
   fibrosis and in 29 per cent of the patients with bronchial asthma;
   none was found in the control subjects. Precipitins to aspergillus
   species were present in 59 per cent of the patients with cystic
   fibrosis, 35 per cent of the patients with bronchial asthma, and 11
   per cent of the control subjects. Greater differences were noted when
   the total number of precipitin bands in each group was compared.
   There was a trend for the more severe cases of cystic fibrosis (based
   on the Shwachman-Kulczycki score) to have a greater incidence of
   precipitins and a lower frequency of IgE antibodies to aspergillus
   than the milder cases. Candida precipitins were found more frequently
   in patients with cystic fibrosis (45 per cent) than in patients with
   bronchial asthma (18 per cent); none was found in the control group.
   The potential role of fungal hypersensitivity in cystic fibrosis and
   the therapeutic implications are discussed in light of these
   findings.

EX A little-known feature of cystic fibrosis is the frequent occurrence
   of positive skin-prick tests to environmental allergies.  In the
   normal population only about half those with positive prick tests
   actually have clinical allergic disease; so, are the positive
   skin-tests of cystic fibrosis clinically important?  In particular,
   do they mean a high prevalence of asthma, overt or hidden, amongst
   these patients?  A general clinical impression is that asthma is no
   more frequent amongst cystic fibrosis than in the normal population.
   The often positive skin tests, although of considerable immunological
   interest, do not necessarily imply additional clinical disease.

AB Two types of turbidity were found in parotid saliva from both cystic
   fibrosis (CF) patients and non-CF subjects. On cooling saliva, a
   rapidly forming, reversible, cold-dependent turbidity appeared in
   increasing amounts with decreasing temperature and increasing protein
   concentration. At 37 degrees, a slowly forming, stable turbidity
   appeared in increased amounts in parotid saliva samples containing
   increased amounts of calcium. The 2 degree centrifuged pellet
   consisted predominantly of protein, whereas the 37 degree pellet
   contained calcium, inorganic phosphate, and protein. The cold-
   dependent turbidity at 2 degrees was not inhibited by EDTA, but 37
   degrees turbidity was dramatically inhibited. Urea and guanidine
   hydrochloride reduced 2 degree turbidity, and, to a lesser extent,
   inhibited 37 degree turbidity. The tendency towards higher levels of
   protein, amylase, and calcium in CF compared with child control
   parotid saliva (4, 6) causes a greater incidence and degree of
   turbidity formation in saliva of CF patients. In this paper only the
   nature of the turbidity has been investigated, not its relative
   occurrence in each group of subjects.

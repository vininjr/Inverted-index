AB Enzyme activity against hippuryl-L-arginine was studied in cultured
   skin fibroblasts from controls and cystic fibrosis patients. The
   enzyme had a lysosomal distribution and an acid optimum of pH 4.5
   with little or no activity present above pH 7.0. Dithiothreitol was
   required for full activity and the kinetics of thiol activation were
   different for the control and cystic fibrosis enzyme. The properties
   and lysosomal distribution of the enzyme indicated that it was a
   carboxypeptidase B. Substrate affinity, thermolability, pH stability,
   the fall and rise in activity with subculture, the cyclical pattern
   of activity through serial passage and the level of activity were
   similar for the control and cystic fibrosis enzyme.

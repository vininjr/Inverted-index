AB The efficiency of delivery of an aerosol to 22 children with cystic
   fibrosis, aged 8 months to 17 years, was investigated with the use
   a standard ultrasonic nebulizer.  The study was designed to simulate
   clinical conditions as closely as possible.  Retention of the
   aerosol was monitored with a scintillation camera interfaced to a
   small digital computer.  The children also had ventilation studies
   with xenon-133, which allowed comparison of the distribution of
   aerosol with regional ventilation.  The aerosol was visualized
   within the lungs of all 22 patients.  Between 0.8 and 6.5 per cent
   of the initial activity was deposited in the lungs, representing an
   average of 0.27 ml. per therapy session or 0.0131 ml. per kilogram
   of body weight.  There was a positive correlation (r = 0.89; p <
   0.01) between increasing age and greater pulmonary deposition of the
   aerosol.  There was decreased aerosol entry to regions which were
   poorly ventilated.  The efficiency of aerosol deposition is variable
   in children with cystic fibrosis, depending primarily on the age of
   the patient, whereas its distribution within their lungs is related
   to regional variations in the severity of the pulmonary disease.

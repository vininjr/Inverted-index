EX We have investigated the fatty-acid composition of serum-lecithins
   from four groups of C.F. patients, defined by their pancreatic
   function evaluated by 72-h quantitative stool fat and determination
   of the coefficient of fat absorption.  C.F. patients without
   pancreatic insufficiency and not on pancreatic extract had
   significantly higher percentages of linoleic acid than did patients
   of any other group.  The altered fatty-acid composition of
   serum-lipid fractions seems to be a secondary consequence of the
   pancreatic insufficiency commonly associated with C.F. disease and
   not a direct metabolic defect as some have suggested.

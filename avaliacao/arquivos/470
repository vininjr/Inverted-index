EX In our patient, the second child of a married couple heterozygous for
   cystic fibrosis , the meconium protein content was higher than that
   of controls.  He has no symptoms of cystic fibrosis.  The
   determination of sodium and chloride ions in the sweat excluded
   homozygosity; the bromide test led us to conclude the child to be a
   heterozygote.  In our patient the protein content of the meconium,
   the majority of which was albumin, was two- to threefold that of the
   controls.  This elevated protein content, however, was not
   characteristic of homozygosity.  Our results lead us to conclude that
   a high protein content of meconium does not unconditionally indicate
   the homozygotic state for cystic fibrosis.  It would appear that
   heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis is not completely without
   abnormality.  Our findings perhaps explain "false positive" results
   recorded in the literature.  High-protein content in the meconium may
   be useful in the identification of heterozygotes too.

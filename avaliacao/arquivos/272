EX In this study, we have compared two groups of children with cystic
   fibrosis.  One group of CF children had severe malnutrition in the
   first year of life, whereas the second group of CF children had not
   been malnourished.  The catch-up growth experienced by both the
   control and malnourished groups was impressive and was generally
   complete in terms of height and weight for age.  This finding is
   consistent with other reports regarding catch-up growth following
   malnutrition associated with celiac disease, anorexia nervosa, renal
   acidosis, Cushing syndrome, and hypothyroidism.  Though the
   malnourished group tended to have lower IQ and school performance
   scores, the differences were not statistically significant except for
   backward digit span.  That difference may indicate an organic
   impairment due to malnutrition or to any of several other factors.
   Our data fail to demonstrate any permanent or devastating effect of
   early malnutrition during a very rapid growth phase on the subsequent
   growth, IQ, and school performance in children with cystic fibrosis
   studied at age 7 to 10 years.

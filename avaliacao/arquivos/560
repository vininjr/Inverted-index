AB Parotid saliva samples from cystic fibrosis homozygotes,
   heterozygotes and normal individuals were tested by the zeta
   potential technique for secretion factor in a double-blind
   experiment. There was no overlap between zeta potential reduction of
   the control group and the cystic fibrosis test groups, indicating
   that the zeta potential test may be detecting a unique component in
   saliva of cystic fibrosis genotypes.

EX We wish to report three cases of hyponatraemic dehydration in
   children with cystic fibrosis admitted to this hospital in late June
   and early July this year.  These three children with cystic fibrosis
   clearly illustrate the danger of the present unusual climatic
   conditions.  The necessity of salt supplementation in these
   environmental circumstances should be emphasised to all concerned
   and, above all, to parents.  The danger of the administration of
   salt-free glucose solutions also should be borne in mind.  In the
   past the case has been argued for a safe electrolyte solution that
   would be commercially available.  In the absence of such a readily
   available form of electrolyte-glucose solution parents will need
   explicit instructions on how the salt supplement should be
   administered.

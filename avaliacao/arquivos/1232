AB With the early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and the better management
   of these patients in childhood increasing numbers are surviving to
   adult life. The main problem requiring continuous medical care in the
   older cystic fibrosis patient is persisting and often progressive
   chest disease. For this reason the cystic fibrosis clinic for
   adolescents and young adults was started in the Western Infirmary in
   1975. This paper presents our observations on 13 patients who had
   attended between 1975 and 1977. Eleven patients are alive and well
   and have shown no evidence of deterioration over this period. Ten are
   at school or in regular employment. With optimum medical supervision
   it is possible to give young adults with cystic fibrosis a worthwhile
   existence.

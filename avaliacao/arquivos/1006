AB Flows measured from maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves were
   used to evaluate the efficacy of postural drainage in improving
   ventilatory function acutely. Maximal expiratory flow-volume curves
   were obtained for 9 cystic fibrosis subjects and 10 subjects with
   chronic bronchitis before and 5, 15, and 45 min after a 30-min
   session of postural drainage with percussion, vibration, and
   coughing. Forced vital capacity (FVC) was significantly increased 45
   min after drainage for the combining group. Flows at high lung
   volumes were different for the 2 subgroups. Subjects with cystic
   fibrosis demonstrated a significant increase in peak expiratory flow
   rates 45 min after drainage and an increase in forced expiratory
   volume in one sec at all time intervals. The subjects with chronic
   bronchitis had a decreased peak expiratory flow rate 5 min after
   drainage, but by 45 min, it had returned to baseline. There was no
   significant change in one-sec forced expiratory volume at any time
   interval for the chronic bronchitis subgroup. Changes in flows at low
   lung volumes were similar for the 2 subgroups. Forty-five min after
   drainage there was an increase in flow rates near 50 per cent of FVC.
   Flows near 25 per cent of FVC were increased 15 and 45 min after
   drainage. This study demonstrated that postural drainage with
   coughing resulted in significant improvement in flows at low lung
   volumes. Changes in flows at high lung volumes were less consistent.

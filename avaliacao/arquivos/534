EX Detection of cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) using out method involves
   rather exacting requirements for the collection of serum samples and
   their subsequent analysis by electrofocusing.  Minor variations in
   the methods described for sample collection and storage may cause
   degradation and loss of CFP and this by itself could lead to
   erroneous results since many CF samples would appear to be CFP
   negative, making it impossible to observe a consistent difference
   between a group of CF samples and normal control samples by
   electrofocusing.  From the results presented by Thomas et al. and
   Figure 1 of the letter by Smith et al., it is obvious that neither
   group has reproduced the protein handling patterns presented in
   either of our previous reports.  The pH gradients are not the same,
   the location of the sample pads relative to the anode are not the
   same, and the protein banding patterns are totally different.  We
   question the validity of the techniques used, claims of having
   reproduced our method for detecting CFP, or supposed improvements
   designed to enhance the detection of CFP.

EX The report by Huff, Huang, and Arey again calls attention to the
   heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis and to the fact that a properly
   performed sweat test in the normal or borderline range does not rule
   out cystic fibrosis.  This may occur in approximately 1% of patients
   we classify as having cystic fibrosis and confirms our original
   impression that the sweat test has a reliability of between 98% and
   99%.  One must pay close attention to the clinical picture, the
   family history, and especially the pulmonary or gastrointestinal
   findings, and provide rational treatment until more acceptable
   evidence of the disease can be documented.  In the same issue is a
   report on a false positive sweat test in a Canadian patient with the
   Mauriac syndrome.  The authors list a variety of conditions that have
   been reported as yielding elevated sweat electrolytes.  The manner of
   the collections can greatly influence the result. - In patients with
   transient abnormal sweat electrolytes, sodium values were
   consistently higher than chloride values.  Perhaps the finding of
   sodium values in excess of chloride in the abnormal range suggests a
   false positive test.

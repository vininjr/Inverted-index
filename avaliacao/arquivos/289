EX Samuels and Elliott have described a new technique for detecting
   cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and the heterozygote for C.F.  We have tested
   this technique in detail on a smaller number of patients.  Although
   the number of samples tested in our study is small, results suggest
   that this technique is not likely to be successful in detection of
   heterozygotes for C.F.

EX Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in
   Great Britain, Central Europe and North America and it affects 1 in
   2000 live born children.  Does the antibiotic treatment in cystic
   fibrosis differ from the treatment of respiratory infection in other
   conditions?  The cystic fibrosis patient not only suffers progressive
   deterioration in respiratory function; he often has dangerous
   complicating conditions culminating in super-infection by highly
   resistant organisms.  The basic principle of antibiotic therapy must
   be rigidly applied in cystic fibrosis.  The first principle is to
   identify the pathogen and its susceptibility to antibiotics.  The
   second principle is to ensure that the chosen antibiotic reaches the
   site of infection.  The third principle is that the antibiotic
   therapy ought to complement the immunological defences of the
   patient.  A fourth principle is that no therapy must be given
   without first deciding upon the criteria which will be acceptable as
   indicating clinical improvement.

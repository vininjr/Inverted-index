AB The significance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the
   respiratory tract of 9 cystic fibrosis patients have been studied
   by means of immunoelectrophoretical analysis of patients' sera for
   the number of precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the
   concentrations of 16 serum proteins.  In addition, the clinical and
   radiographical status of the lungs have been evaluated using 2
   scoring systems.  Precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
   demonstrated in all sera, the maximum number in one serum was 22.
   The concentrations of 12 of the serum proteins were significantly
   changed compared with matched control persons.  Notably IgG and IgA
   were elevated and the "acute phase proteins" were changed, the
   latter suggesting active tissue damage.  The concentrations of 3 of
   the acute phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, were correlated to
   the number of precipitins suggesting that the respiratory tract
   infection in patients with many precipitins is accompanied by more
   tissue damage than the infection in patients with few precipitins.
   The results indicate no protective value of the many precipitins on
   the tissue of the respiratory tract.

AB The effectiveness and safety of tobramycin against infections due to
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis were studied
   in 15 patients with moderate-to-severe exacerbation of chronic
   pulmonary infection. Seventeen courses of treatment were given.
   Tobramycin (5-7.5 mg/kg per day) was administered intravenously in
   three divided doses per day (seven to 21 days). All specimens of
   sputum yielded moderate-to-heavy growth of P. aeruginosa; all
   isolates were inhibited by 4 mug of tobramycin/ml, and in seven cases
   isolates were not inhibited by 4 mug of gentamicin/ml. The mean
   levels of tobramycin in the blood were 4.4 mug/ml 0.5-1 hr and 0.8
   mug/ml 7.5-8 hr after administration. All patients received an
   antistaphylococcal agent before, during, and after therapy. All
   patients except for two received 750 mg of carbenicillin/kg per day
   intravenously in six divided doses and 1 g of carbenicillin in a mask
   for inhalation three times a day. Both clinical and radiological
   improvement was noted in all patients. The white blood cell count,
   which was elevated in seven patients, returned to normal, and levels
   of blood gases improved. P. aeruginosa was eliminated from the sputum
   in five cases. No adverse side effects were noted.

AB Sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis are the most frequent lethal
   inherited diseases in the black and white population, respectively.
   The occurrence of both diseases in the same individual has not been
   reported in the literature.  This report presents two such patients
   and poses questions concerning the possible clinical implications of
   the simultaneous occurrence of both diseases.

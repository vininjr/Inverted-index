EX Usually cardiac affection in cystic fibrosis is secondary to
   progressive affection of the lungs (cor pulmonale).  In rare cases,
   babies and young children show a primary and severe cardiac affection
   caused by myocardial fibrosis.  We could recently observe two of
   these cases in our clinic.  The cases are presented and discussed.
   In babies and young children cardiac insufficiency  caused by
   cardiomyopathy might be the first presenting symptom in CF.
   Therefore, in all children with cardiomyopathy of unknown origin, CF
   has to be suspected and the sweat test has to be performed.  Rapidly
   progressive cardiac insufficiency responding poorly to treatment and
   rhythm disturbances are typical.  Correct early diagnosis is
   important for early genetic counseling.

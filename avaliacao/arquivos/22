AB Airway resistance and lung volume were measured by a modification of
   the plethysmographic method of Briscoe and DuBois (1) to calculate
   specific airway resistance (SRaw) on 263 control subjects ranging in
   age from the newborn to 54 years.  the mean SRaw was lowest in the
   newborn period and increased rapidly to adult levels during the
   first years of life.  In each age group, the mean SRaw was lower for
   females than it was for males.  No control subject had an SRaw
   greater than 8 sec cm H2O.  A decrease in mean SRaw from 4.2 sec cm
   H2O for females 5 to 9 years of age to 3.5 sec cm H2O for those over
   18 years of age paralleled sexual maturation, but similar changes
   were not observed in the males.  A direct correlation of SRaw with
   clinical observations was found in young patients with various
   degrees of pulmonary involvement because of cystic fibrosis.

AB The occurrence of antibodies against antigens prepared from strains
   representing 13 O groups of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against a
   polyvalent Ps. aeruginosa antigen (St-Ag) has been investigated in
   sera from 100 patients. By means of fused rocket
   immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel it was found that the
   humoral immune response against Ps. aeruginosa resulting in
   precipitating antibodies will be detected by St-Ag as well as by any
   other of the antigen samples investigated. Six of the sera contained
   group-specific antibodies which were revealed by only one of the
   antigen samples used and not by St-Ag. These six sera were further
   studied by means of various quantitative immunoelectrophoretic
   methods using St-Ag as well as antigens prepared from the infecting
   Ps. aeruginosa strain in the patient concerned. In all six sera, only
   one extra precipitin could be detected using antigens prepared from
   the homologous strain instead of St-Ag. This extra precipitin
   corresponded presumably to group-specific O-antigens not included in
   St-Ag. In sera from patients, these group-specific antibodies were
   always accompanied by antibodies against antigens common to all
   strains of Ps. aeruginosa.

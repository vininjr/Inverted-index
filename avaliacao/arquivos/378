AB During a screening programme for the detection of CF using the
   meconium albumin technique, the overall false-positive rate was found
   to be approximately 1%. When the gestational age of the infants was
   taken into account the false-positive rate was found to be
   significantly higher in preterm (8%) as compared to term infants
   (0.55%). This was due largely but not solely to the presence of
   occult blood. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed
   and attention drawn to the limitation of meconium albumin content as
   a screening technique for CF in preterm infants.

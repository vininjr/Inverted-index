EX The aim of our clinical study was to find if prolonged tobramycin
   therapy can prevent further rapid deterioration in cystic fibrosis
   patients.  Eleven courses of treatment were given to the nine
   patients.  Eight of these markedly improved their physical activity
   and gained weight.  However, only in four of these patients was
   clinical improvement correlated with an improved radiogram.
   Pseudomonas was eradicated from the sputum of only four patients
   during therapy but reappeared in three of them before the end of
   therapy.  Clinical improvement and negligible side effects suggest
   treatment of exacerbating Pyocyaneus bronchopneumonia with prolonged
   tobramycin therapy.  Dosage should be higher than 5 mg/kg/day with
   strict control of tobramycin blood level and awareness of side
   effects.

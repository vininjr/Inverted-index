EX This study investigated the roles of hypoxia, pulmonary mechanics,
   nutritional status and serum fatty acid composition in limiting
   exercise tolerance in cystic fibrosis.  Twenty children with CF of
   carrying severity performed two progressive exercise tests on a cycle
   ergometer, once while breathing air, once while breathing O2. The
   children with the lower maximal mid-expiratory flow rates tended to
   have very little respiratory reserve at the final work load.  We
   conclude that nutritional status and airway obstruction are closely
   correlated with exercise tolerance in CF and that, unlike the adult
   with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, exercise limiting
   dyspnoea occurs in the presence of normal end-tidal CO2.

EX Infertility and abnormalities of the mesonephric derivatives are
   common in patients with cystic fibrosis, but it is not a uniform
   finding.  Taussig et al. reported on 2 patients with cystic fibrosis
   who had proved fertility.  Abnormalities of the vas could be
   documented in pathologic studies, but the vas was found to be present
   in some patients who died of cystic fibrosis.  In many patients,
   absence could not be ruled out on physical examination.  In healthy,
   young children the vas is not easily palpable; even when it is, the
   degree of certainty in its identification is less than in the
   post-pubertal male.  Cystic fibrosis is a disease with protean
   manifestations, and it would be a mistake to rule out cystic fibrosis
   just because the vas can be palpated or to have victims of cystic
   fibrosis labeled as infertile.

EX We found that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with pancreatic
   insufficiency (PI) had a statistically lower total serum amylase
   level than normal subjects, but all values were still within the
   normal range.  Although we found that the absolute amount of salivary
   amylase, in the serum of patients with CF and PI, was the same as
   that for normal subjects, the percent of contribution was
   considerably higher.  We found that the pancreas contributed
   approximately 23% of the total serum amylase in CF patients with PI,
   a value very similar to the 34% amount found by Kamaryt et al.  We
   also found, as did Davidson et al., that CF patients without PI had
   higher total serum amylase values than did normal subjects.  Thus,
   we feel that Davidson et al. have misinterpreted the results of our
   previous study and, in fact, we feel that Davidson et al. have
   essentially confirmed our previous work by suggesting that CF
   patients with pancreatic insufficiency have an increased salivary
   amylase for reasons yet unknown.  Our experience has shown that,
   indeed, the pancreatic portion is first increased and then decreases
   as the patient with CF and apparent normal pancreatic function
   progresses, with time, toward pancreatic insufficiency.  However, the
   changes in serum amylase values in patients with CF are on the
   average due to changes in the pancreatic contribution to the serum
   and as expressed as a mean was highly significantly different for
   both normal and abnormal pancreatic function.  The second important
   point of our paper was that this mean variation occurred in serum
   samples from patients with CF that had total amylase values within
   the normal test range.  The serum salivary isoamylase in both normals
   and patients with CF and PI had a higher serum salivary percent.

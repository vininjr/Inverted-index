EX With improvement in the treatment of children suffering from cystic
   fibrosis and increase in the average survival to about 17 years of
   age, many more patients with this disease are now coming under the
   care of thoracic physicians.  In nearly every patient,
   broncho-pulmonary disease is the major problem.  Pneumothorax is
   encountered in about 15% of the older patients and some of these
   occur bilaterally.  A few patients develop refractory airways
   obstruction and then a trial of steroids is justifiable.  Most
   patients with cystic fibrosis also require treatment for their
   pancreatic insufficiency.  Diabetes mellitus is more common in cystic
   fibrosis than in the normal population.  Analysis of sweat is
   essential for diagnosis.  The psychological stresses imposed upon
   patients and their families are very great.

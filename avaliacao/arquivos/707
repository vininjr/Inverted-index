AB Using bioassay method (rat blood pressure technique) as well as the
   radioimmunoassay, renin-like activity (RLA) was measured in eccrine
   sweat of patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (CF) and of
   controls. Sweat-formation was induced by pilocarpine-iontophoresis or
   by local injection of carbamylcholine (Doryl). RLA-values between O
   (not measurable) and 460 ng/ml.h were measured. With increasing sweat
   flow-rate a tendency to lower RLA-values was detected. No significant
   difference was observed between CF and controls. From the observation
   that RLA of sweat is up to 30 times higher than that of plasma, it is
   concluded that RLA is probably released not from plasma but from the
   sweat glands themselves, where it is stored or synthesized.

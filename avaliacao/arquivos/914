AB Forty-six patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), 1 month to 32 years of
   age, had 51 episodes of assisted ventilation. Thirty-five (69%) died
   after 1 to 395 days of mechanical ventilation and six others (12%)
   died in the hospital 1 to 42 days after assisted ventilation therapy
   was discontinued. Only three patients survived longer than one year
   after discharge. These results are much poorer than those reported
   for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of other
   causes probably because of the different natural history and response
   to therapy in CF. Patients with CF whose conditions progressively
   deteriorated despite optimal therapy and no longer respond to
   antibiotic and physical therapy are not good candidates for
   mechanical ventilation. The occasional patient with good baseline
   status in whom acute respiratory failure develops should be
   considered for assisted ventilation.

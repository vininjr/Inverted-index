AB The bacteriological effect of chemotherapy against mucoid strains of
   Pseudominas aeruginosa in the lower respiratory tract of patients
   with cystic fibrosis is reported. A comparison of the effect of high
   doses of tobramycin (10 mg/kg/24 h) given alone or in combination
   with carbenicillin showed a significant difference in favour of the
   combination therapy. In 74.5% of the initially successful courses the
   patients were recolonized within one month. Fifty-three patients were
   examined by audiometric and vestibular tests. Only in one patient was
   it possible to register a transient, high tone hearing impairment at
   8000 Hz bilaterally, that might be attributed to the tobramycin
   treatment. It is concluded that high dose tobramycin treatment in
   children and adolescents with normal kidney function implies only a
   minimal clinical risk of adverse ototoxic effects, even after
   repeated courses of treatment. No nephrotoxic side-effects were found
   in this material.

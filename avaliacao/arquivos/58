EX Chronic sinusitis in young children does not often invoke "sinus"
   complaints of fullness, discomfort, or pain over the affected sinus,
   for it is only the older child who verbalizes these complaints.
   Rather, it is the secondary signs and symptoms that lead the
   physician to suspect this entity in children.  The most common of
   these are chronic nasal discharge and chronic nasal obstruction.  A
   careful nasal examination is essential for the recognition of chronic
   sinusitis, the most common predecessor of chronic sinusitis.
   Allergic rhinitis is probably the second most common background of
   acute and then chronic sinusitis.  Chronic sinusitis in children with
   cystic fibrosis is a characteristic finding.  Sinusitis is common in
   cleft lip and cleft palate children.  Infants and children with
   clinical signs of chronic infection and radiographic changes should
   have a nose culture and sensitivity studies to plan appropriate
   antibiotic therapy.  Surgical therapy is indicated when the symptoms,
   such as chronic pain, chronic otitis media, chronic bronchitis,
   orbital infections, or intracranial complications, occur.

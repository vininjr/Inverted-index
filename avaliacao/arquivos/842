AB Pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary complications were studied in
   a group of 40 patients with cystic fibrosis who reached the age of 25
   years. Mean values for vital capacity (VC), functional residual
   capacity, residual volume (RV), the ratio of RV over total lung
   capacity (RV/TLC), conductance, and the ratio of the forced
   expiratory volume in one second over VC were abnormal. There was a
   variable pattern of progression from patient to patient. The men
   differed from the women only in that they had a significantly larger
   TLC and inspiratory capacity than the women. The resultant
   preservation of VC may have an advantage for survival in those
   patients in whom it is observed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was
   encountered with increasing frequency with age. Massive hemoptysis
   did not result in early death. The occurrence of rightsided heart
   failure secondary to cor pulmonale, with or without respiratory
   failure, was a poor prognostic sign.

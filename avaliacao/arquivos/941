EX Cystic fibrosis is a fatal inherited disease involving many different
   organs.  At one time most affected children died within a few years
   of birth but modern management has led to a marked improvement in
   prognosis and, of course, to an increase in the number of affected
   older children and young adults.  Cystic fibrosis is, therefore, no
   longer a disease encountered only in paediatric units, but with
   increasing survival into teens and twenties affected patients are now
   appearing in adult units.  The aetiology and pathology, the clinical
   picture, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are discussed.

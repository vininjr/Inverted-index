EX We assayed the serum of a group of cystic fibrosis patients that
   were on oral arginine therapy and that of a group of cystic
   fibrosis patients that were not receiving this treatment for total
   arginine esterase activity.  The untreated cystic fibrosis patients
   have significantly lower serum arginine esterase activity than the
   normal controls, the cystic fibrosis carriers, and the cystic
   fibrosis patients receiving oral arginine therapy.  There is no
   significant difference between the arginine esterase activity of
   the normal controls and the cystic fibrosis carriers or the cystic
   fibrosis patients treated with arginine. -  We have recently
   observed differences in the arginine esterases in plasma of
   controls and patients by electrofusing on polyacrylamide gels.
   Six activity bands could be detected in plasma of controls, whereas
   only five could be detected in plasma of patients.  Our work on the
   deficiency of trypsin-like activity in mixed saliva of patients
   with cystic fibrosis has been reproduced by another laboratory.
   Coburn recently confirmed our work on deficiency of arginine
   esterase in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis. At present, the
   deficiency of arginine esterase in cystic fibrosis is a working
   hypothesis to understand the basic defect. - The variations of pH
   and sodium chloride content that I employed had been tested by me
   in 6 patients both with and without a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
   and were found not to alter the level of arginine-esterase
   activity.  The major differences between the two studies resulted
   from the control subjects.  Dr. Rao neglects to mention the few
   other laboratories that were unable to confirm his findings.

EX Many conditions have been reported to cause vocal cord paralysis.
   To our knowledge cystic fibrosis has not been described as one of
   these conditions.  A 15-year-old white male with cystic fibrosis,
   who has been treated at our hospital, reported hoarseness of two
   week's duration on a routine clinic visit in March, 1973.  In March,
   1974, mirror laryngoscopy revealed a paralysis of the left vocal
   cord in the paramedian position, consistent with paralysis of the
   left recurrent laryngeal nerve.  It is felt that the vocal cord
   paralysis in this patient with cystic fibrosis is due to compression
   of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by an enlarged pulmonary artery.

AB Transit time analysis of the forced expiratory vital capacity
   maneuver was applied to 37 patients with cystic fibrosis 8 to 22
   years of age. This analysis divides the vital capacity into segments
   of air and assigns a transit time to each segment. The
   characteristics of the distribution of these transit times are used
   as measurements of pulmonary function. The quantities were compared
   with the forced vital capacity, 1-sec forced expiratory volume, ratio
   of 1-sec forced expiratory volume to vital capacity, peak flow,
   forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital
   capacity, maximal expiratory flow at 25 per cent of the vital
   capacity, specific airway conductance, and arterial PO2 of these
   patients. The standard deviation of the transit times was the most
   frequently abnormal. The mean transit time had the largest range of
   values in terms of its own standard deviation, and it was the best
   single estimate of over-all lung function because it correlated
   almost equally with large and small airway function. The coefficient
   of cariance of transit times was specific in detecting abnormality of
   small airways and was as sensitive in the detection of minimal lung
   disease as the standard deviation of transit times.

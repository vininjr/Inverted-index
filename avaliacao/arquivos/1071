AB To nine cystic fibrosis patients with chronic bronchopulmonary
   infection of severely damaged lungs invaded by Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, eleven courses of prolonged tobramycin treatment (5
   mg/kg/day) for four to 16 weeks were administered. Pulmonary symptoms
   improved and a better quality of life was achieved in all but one
   patient. Objective parameters (chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests)
   changed to a lesser extent. In only one patient was Pseudomonas
   eradicated from the sputum but reappeared after discontinuation of
   therapy. In the rest of the patients Pseudomonas was significantly
   suppressed or replaced by other pathogens. Four patients showed rises
   of antibody titres to Candida and two to Aspergillus fumigatus. No
   nephrotoxic side effects were observed, but vestibular function was
   reversibly impaired in one patient without corresponding clinical
   symptoms. No bacterial resistance to tobramycin was observed during
   therapy.

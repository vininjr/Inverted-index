AB Anatomical dead space was measured in 72 normal children aged from 5
   to 16 years, using the single breath method. There was a linear
   increase in this measurement with height, weight, and end-inspiratory
   lung volume. Physiological dead space was measured in 52 normal
   children using the Bohr equation and substituting a rebreathing PCO2
   for alveolar PCO2. There was a parallel increase in this measurement
   with height, weight, and end-inspiratory lung volume. The difference
   between the two dead space measurements constitutes the alveolar dead
   space and was constant over the whole age range at 45 +/- 22 ml. The
   ratio of physiological dead space to tidal volume was 33-6 +/-4-6%
   and was unaltered by age or change in lung volume. The effect of
   airways obstruction on the dead space volumes was studied in 36
   children with asthma and 28 with cystic fibrosis. Physiological dead
   space increased with increasing airways obstruction. Anatomical dead
   space remained constant in spite of marked increases in lung volume
   associated with the airways obstruction.

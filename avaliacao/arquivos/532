AB The purpose of this investigation was twofold: (1) to identify and
   characterize the enzymatic ATP hydrolysis system of epithelial cilia,
   and (2) to develop a quantitative, biochemical test for the
   ciliotoxic cystic fibrosis (CF) factor based on inhibition of ATP
   utilization by ciliary preparations. Our rationale for selecting this
   system for CF factor analysis relates to the tight and essential
   mechanochemical coupling of functioning cilia. Using rabbit tracheal
   epithelium as the source, a high molecular weight (greater than
   200,000) ATPase was identified, partially purified, and extensively
   characterized. The properties of this protein were similar to those
   observed in previous studies of others with flagellar and ciliary
   dynein (the motility-associated ATPase) isolated from microorganisms.
   Analysis of the pH profile revealed a broad range of high enzymatic
   activity between 6.5 and 9. Studies with potential cation activators
   showed that the enzyme is activated equally by either Ca2+ or Mg2+ in
   equimolar concentrations. No activation occurred in the presence of
   Zn2+, Na+, H+, or Na+ plus K+ and the effect of Mg2+ or Ca2+ was not
   inhibited by Na+, K+, or Na+ plus K+. The enzyme hydrolyzed Mg2+-
   containing solutions of UTP, CTP, and ADP at 51-54% the rate of ATP
   dephosphorylation, whereas Mg-deoxy-ATP was hydrolyzed 79% as
   effectively as ATP. Using a newly devised, analytical technique with
   [gamma-32P]ATP as the substrate, the ATP hydrolysis of various
   ciliary preparations from rabbit trachea and oyster gill (including
   motile suspensions) was monitored in the presence of sera from CF
   homo- and heterozygotes. Reproducible rates of ATP dephosphorylation
   averaging 27 nmol/min/mg protein were demonstrable with homogenates
   of ciliated epithelium. None of the test systems evaluated, however,
   were capable of demonstrating CF-related differences in ATPase
   activity or ATP utilization. Although these attemps have been
   unsuccessful thus far, the approach described in this report provides
   an example of an objective, quantitative, biochemical assessment of
   ciliary function.

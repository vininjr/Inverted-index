AB ATPase activity and monovalent cation transport were examined in
   erythrocytes (RBC) of subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The RBC
   membrane (Ca2+)ATPase activity of homozygous patients and obligate
   heterozygotes was indistinguishable from that of normal control
   subjects.  This was true similarly for total, ouabain-sensitive,
   and ouabain-insensitive (Na+-K+)ATPase.  Total, ouabain-sensitive,
   and ouabain-insensitive 24Na+ transport were normal in CF cells.
   Ouabain-induced Na+ accumulation was similar in CF and normal RBC.
   Measurements of K+ transport in CF RBC were, likewise, normal.  We
   conclude that intrinsic ATPase and monovalent transport functions
   are normal in CF RBC.  We were unable to confirm several
   abnormalities in these cells reported previously.  The CF RBC is not
   helpful in defining a transport abnormality in that entity.  These
   studies document normal intrinsic transport function in RBC of
   patients with CF.  There have been reports of an abnormal serum
   factor in patients with CF.  This factor might be involved in the
   production of a transport defect in CF.  Further studies are
   indicated to determine whether CF plasma contains a factor capable
   of altering membrane transport functions of normal RBC.

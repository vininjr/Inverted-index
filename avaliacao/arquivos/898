EX In the February, 1977, issue of The Journal, Dr. Heffer comments on
   publications concerning the occurrence of cystic fibrosis (CF) in
   black children.  He "feels" that CF occurs more frequently than we
   have reported.  Our ten-year search in the Washington, D.C., area
   shows a minimum incidence of cystic fibrosis among black newborn
   infants as one per 17,000.  Since 1972, we have identified an
   additional four black patients with cystic fibrosis in black
   children.  This is consistent with the previously reported incidence
   of one in 17,000.  Therefore, we disagree with Heffer, that this is a
   common disease among blacks.

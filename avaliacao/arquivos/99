AB A 3-day-old infant, meconium stained at birth, presented with
   respiratory distress.  Hypoplastic left heart syndrome was diagnosed
   clinically and documented at autopsy.  Unsuspected cystic fibrosis
   was demonstrated by the histologic presence of severe focal biliary
   cirrhosis with spreading fibrosis in the liver; minimal lesions in
   the pancreas and intestines were compatible with a diagnosis of
   cystic fibrosis.  The abundant hepatic fibrosis is unusual in an
   infant of this age indicating its in utero origin.  This case is
   also unusual because of the fortuitous association of cystic
   fibrosis and a congenital cardiac malformation.

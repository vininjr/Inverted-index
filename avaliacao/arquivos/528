AB A serum factor was demonstrated in normal individuals which (1)
   enhances the incorporation of L-[3H]fucose into cultured human skin
   fibroblasts, (2) is nondialyzable, (3) is heat labile at 50 degrees,
   (4) is present in the noneuglobulin fraction, and (5) appears to be
   deficient in serum from patients with cystic fibrosis. The specific
   activity of L-[3H]fucose incorporated into skin fibroblasts from
   normal individuals in the presence of serum from 12 control subjects
   was 3,337 +/- 168 cpm/mg protein in contrast to 2,294 +/- 172, the
   activity obtained either in the presence of serum from 10 age-matched
   patients with cystic fibrosis or in the absence of serum. These
   differences were significant at P less than 0.001. In comparison, no
   significant difference was detected in the amount of L-[3H]fucose
   incorporated into skin fibroblasts derived from normal individuals
   and patients with cystic fibrosis. The plasma membrane of cultured
   skin fibroblasts derived from patients with cystic fibrosis appears
   to be grossly unaltered in its protein and L-fucose labeling pattern.

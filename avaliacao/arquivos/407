AB Thin-layer isoelectric focusing was performed on samples of sera from
   patients with Cystic Fibrosis, siblings and obligate heterozygotes
   (parents), and children without cystic fibrosis (controls). The
   protein band with an isoelectric point of pH 5.48, previously
   reported to be absent in homozygote cystic fibrosis sera, was found
   to have a pI of 5.25. It was present in approximately one-half of the
   homozygote and heterozygote sera tested, and absent from 18 percent
   of control sera. The presence of this band is not therefore a
   reliable marker for the normal gene, and cannot be used to identify
   the heterozygous carrier for cystic fibrosis.

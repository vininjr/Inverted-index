   INFANT.  MALE.
EX A patient with cystic fibrosis was encountered who presented with
   anemia, hypoproteinemia, edema and failure to thrive.  A blood
   transfusion resulted in some improvement, but the symptoms recurred
   in a few weeks.  Only after the correct diagnosis was made and
   appropriate therapy instituted did the patient show signs of
   improvement.  The account of this case illustrates the importance of
   considering the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in any child with
   malnutrition.

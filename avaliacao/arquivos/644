EX We suggest that the intrauterine detection of cystic fibrosis may be
   based on the investigation of the amniotic fluid.  It is known that
   the protein content of the meconium of homozygotic newborn infants
   is significantly increased, whereas that of heterozygotic infants is
   only moderately increased.  As a result of intrauterine intestinal
   activity, the bowel content may be excreted into the amniotic fluid;
   thus a detectable deviation in the protein content of amniotic fluid
   may be expected.  We decided to determine the total protein content
   and the amount of acid-soluble glycoproteins in 86 amniotic fluid
   samples, both by polography and by measuring the hexose content.  In
   the homozygous case a slight increase was observed in total protein
   content, whereas in the heterozygous cases no changes were observed.

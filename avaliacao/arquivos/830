EX Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease, usually fatal
   before the third decade, characterized by chronic obstructive lung
   disease, elevated sweat electrolyte concentrations, and pancreatic
   insufficiency.  The present investigation was carried out to
   determine if P-type serum RNase activity was reduced in CF patients 3
   to 24 years of age.  No difference in serum RNase activity was found
   among the groups of 17 normals, 21 CF patients, and 5 CF
   heterozygotes.  It appears that observations of decreased RNase
   activity in the serum of young children with pancreatic insufficiency
   cannot be extended to older children, at least without withholding
   pancreatic supplements.

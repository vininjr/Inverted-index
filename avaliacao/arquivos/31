AB The hypothesis that mist tent therapy decreases the viscosity of
   sputum by direct liquefaction of the sputum in the lower respiratory
   tract was tested in 6 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The first
   night all patients slept without the mist tent and the first morning
   sputum was collected for analysis.  The following 2 nights patients
   were randomly allocated to a tent supplied by either a jet or
   ultrasonic nebulizer.  The early morning sputum was analysed for
   volume, viscosity, water content, and DNA content, an index of
   purulence.  There was no relation between sputum viscosity and DNA
   content, water content, or volume.  Furthermore, there was no
   consistent relation between sputum viscosity or volume expectorated
   and the presence or absence of an 8-hour stay in the tent with
   either method of water nebulization.  These results therefore
   suggest that mist therapy does not consistently influence sputum
   viscosity or volume in patients with CF.  Above a sputum water
   content of 90%, further increases in water content do not influence
   viscosity.

AB A group of 102 obligate heterozygotes for the cystic fibrosis gene
   were examined for genetic type of pancreatic isoamylases as well as
   enzyme activity of pancreatic iso-amylases, salivary isoamylases and
   total amylase in serum. The analysis was performed using
   electrophoretic separation for detection of the various types of
   isoamylases, and their relative activity was determined by means of
   densitometry. The activities of salivary isoamylases and total
   amylase in serum showed no significant differences between the cystic
   fibrosis heterozygotes and a control group. The frequency of the
   variant gene for pancreatic isoamylase was also the same as in the
   controls. The mean value for pancreatic isoamylase was slightly
   higher in the cystic fibrosis heterozygotes than in the control group
   (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.02).

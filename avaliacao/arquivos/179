AB During the recent decade, 1651 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from
   111 patients with cystic fibrosis have been tested for antibiotic
   sensitivity and half of the isolates have been phage typed. All the
   patients were followed in one clinic and the policy of antibiotic
   treatment was consistent during this period. The results show a
   dynamic situation where "epidemic" phage types during recent years
   have been gradually replaced by other types and, during the same
   period, the prevalence of strains resistant to more than one
   antibiotic decreased. Multiresistant strains including strains
   resistant to methicillin were infrequent in these patients. From 23
   per cent of the patients, the same strains were repeatedly isolated
   for more than 1 year despite an apparently successful chemotherapy.
   Recently isolated strains were found to produce cellbound as well as
   extracellular protein A. Ninety-one per cent of the strains produced
   extracellular lipase and only 8 per cent were resistant to mercury
   chloride. Eighty-one per cent of the patients produced precipitating
   antibodies against S. aureus as judged by crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis. The investigated properties of S. aureus were
   not significantly correlated with the occurrence of precipitating
   antibodies against these bacteria. The possible significance of
   protein A in the pathology of the respiratory tract infection is
   discussed.

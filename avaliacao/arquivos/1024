   TIME-FACTORS.
AB It is confirmed that the level of alkaline phosphatase in fibroblasts
   derived from cystic fibrosis patients can be induced many-fold by
   growing the cells in the presence of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein. It
   is further shown that normal fibroblasts produce a "CF corrective
   factor" which markedly inhibits this phenomenon. These observations
   support a previous hypothesis on the nature of the metabolic defect
   in cystic fibrosis.

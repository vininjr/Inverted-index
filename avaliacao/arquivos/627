EX Cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) is the most common potentially
   lethal autosomal recessive disease in Caucasian peoples.  Despite
   much research and several promising leads there is no completely
   reliable test for detecting heterozygotes, nor a test for the
   identification of the affected homozygous fetus in utero.  Attention
   is being focused on the value and the means of screening newborn
   infants.  Pilot studies carried out in the past six years have
   indicated two main possibilities.  Firstly, the examination of
   meconium for excess albumin, refined to include immunoelectrophoretic
   estimation of the albumin alpha-1 antitrypsin ratio, disaccharidases,
   and lysosomal enzymes.  A second approach is based on the work with a
   chloride-sensitive electrode, which has been modified recently to
   give greater precision in measurement of neonatal sweat electrolytes.
   While the tests available are reasonably accurate, collaborative
   trials and respiratory could improve their efficiency still further.
   Nevertheless, any screening test is presumptive only, and there must
   be an adequate back-up service with a specific validated diagnostic
   test.

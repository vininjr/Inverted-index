EX It has been claimed that the nitroblue tetrazolium (N.B.T.) test is
   of value in the surveillance of children with cystic fibrosis, a
   positive test giving evidence of active bacterial infection which
   may not be apparent clinically and not made evident by such
   investigations as the white-blood-cell count, sputum culture, and
   chest X-ray.  The test was therefore included in the routine
   assessment of patients attending this clinic.  Of the total 269
   N.B.T. tests, 110 were positive.  In only 57 of these cases was
   there other evidence of infection; these 57 were treated with
   antibiotics.  The remaining 53 were left untreated.  Of these, 41
   remained completely free of infection by standard criteria at
   subsequent review.  In 12 cases, however, the patient developed
   obvious infection before the next clinic visit.  It could be argued
   that in those cases the N.B.T. test had given early evidence of
   infection not otherwise apparent.  This is by no means certain,
   since the onset of infection could have been at any time during the
   four-week interval.  In our experience, the N.B.T. has been of
   little help in the management of cystic fibrosis.  There were in
   this series 27% false-negatives and at least 37% false-positives,
   some of which had very high counts.  It is possible, however, that
   in 12 (i.e., 4%) of the tests carried out, the N.B.T. gave early
   indication of infection not otherwise suspected.

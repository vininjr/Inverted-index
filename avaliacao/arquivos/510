EX Cystic fibrosis has attracted the attention of biomedical
   investigators because it is the most prevalent chronic disease
   inherited in Caucasian children.  Carriers of the gene leading to
   cystic fibrosis occur quite frequently in the Caucasian population.
   A major aim in research on cystic fibrosis is the development of a
   test that will offer reliable detection of the heterozygote and of
   the fetus with cystic fibrosis.  Considerable numbers of patients
   with this disease are not diagnosed until after death.  The therapy
   of patients with cystic fibrosis is still symptomatic and includes
   appropriate diet (or diets), pancreatic enzyme and vitamin
   supplementation, treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary
   involvement and chronic infections by antibiotics, physical therapy
   and inhalation therapy, psychoemotional support, and vocational
   rehabilitation.

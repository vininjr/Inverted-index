   SKIN-TESTS.
EX Patients with cystic fibrosis have a higher incidence of positive
   skin prick tests than normal; this may be the result of defective
   antigen handling at mucosal surfaces.  Our aim was to investigate
   bronchial allergy in a group of children with CF and positive skin
   tests.  We studied 15 children aged 7 to 16 years with mild to
   moderate respiratory disease.  Only 1 child gave a history of
   wheezing not associated with chest infections and this study supports
   the hypothesis that clinical asthma is a product of bronchial allergy
   and broncholability.  The responses to bronchial provocation with
   Aspergillus suggest that allergy to this antigen may play a part in
   the pathogenesis of lung disease in some patients with CF.

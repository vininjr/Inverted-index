AB High speed cinemicrographs are made on the ciliary activity of rabbit
   tracheal cilia with the aid of Nomarski optics. The detailed nature
   of the ciliary beat pattern is determined from slow motion analysis
   of the high speed cinemicrographs (1-3). Such documented forms of
   ciliary beat pattern and the physiologic state of the tracheal
   epithelia are utilized as basic reference controls to investigate the
   physiologic effects of cystic fibrosis serum on ciliated epithelia
   and the cystic fibrosis tracheal mucus stagnation phenomenon. Careful
   analyses of the high speed cinemicrographs reveal that cystic
   fibrosis serum has no effect on the rhythm and beat pattern of rabbit
   tracheal cilia. However, it is shown in controlled procedures that
   cystic fibrosis serum has a cytolytic effect on the tracheal
   epithelial cells and also at the cell junctions. Ciliary dyskinesis,
   as described in previous reports (6-9), is actually a secondary
   effect of cytolysis and cell destruction.

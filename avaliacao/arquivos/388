AB Disease in the small airways leads to alteration in the slope of
   phase III of the single breath nitrogen washout following a breath
   of 100% oxygen.  Normal children and those with asthma and cystic
   fibrosis were studied by this technique.  Measurement of the slope
   of phase III of the single breath washout appeared to be a sensitive
   indicator of abnormal pulmonary function in children with these
   diseases.  Results obtained in many children with cystic fibrosis
   suggested that the upper lung regions were predominantly affected.

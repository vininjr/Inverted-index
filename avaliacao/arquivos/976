AB On 100 sputum specimens selected from patients suffering  from
   chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, asthma, and cystic fibrosis total
   deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content has been related to macroscopic
   type, to total dry weight yield, and to the apparent viscosity of the
   secretion at 1350 s-1: since DNA may be present, either as fibres or
   within cells, in one-third of the specimens the contribution of each
   form to the apparent viscosity was assessed. The effect on sputum
   viscosity of the addition of DNA in vitro has also been studied.
   Whereas between mucoid, mucopurulent, and purulent macroscopic types
   a significant difference in total DNA and dry weight yield has been
   found, viscosity was not significantly correlated with purulence.
   Similarly, the concentration of either cells or fibres correlated
   significantly with total DNA but not with viscosity. The in vitro
   addition of DNA to sputum caused a significant increase in its
   viscosity, and reasons for the differences between the iv vivo and in
   vitro effect are discussed. Certain constituents of purulent sputum
   tend to increase viscosity and others to reduce it, and the influence
   of these varies in the several diseases studied.

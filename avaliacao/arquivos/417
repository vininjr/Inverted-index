AB A simple and rapid method for the diagnosis of steatorrhea is
   described. The method is based on the assessment of the difference of
   specific gravity and lipophilic property between a normal stool and
   that in steatorrhea, using a benzene-NaBr system. The stool samples
   are dried, pulverized, and then investigated. Steatorrhea is defined
   either as a fat or more in a 24-hour sample. Stool samples of 71
   infants and children were examined. Among these were 23 healthy
   subjects, 10 with upper respiratory tract infections, and 6 with
   pneumonia. A further 31 children had celiac disease, 9 of them were
   on a gluten-free diet, and one child had cystic fibrosis. The
   procedure described renders single stool samples suitable for the
   assessment of steatorrhea. As a screening test the method proved to
   be rapid and accurate in the diagnosis of steatorrhea.

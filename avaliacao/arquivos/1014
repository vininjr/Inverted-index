AB During a 4-year routine screening programme for cystic fibrosis (CF)
   15 464 specimens were examined for raised meconium albumin levels by
   a test strip method and by electroimmunoassay. The incidence of false-
   positive results was about 5 per 1000 specimens in either test. This
   could be reduced by 90% by determining the ratio of albumin : alpha-1-
   trypsin inhibitor (a ratio below 2.0 being considered as a negative
   result), and it could be reduced to zero by determining the ratio in
   subsequent faecal specimens. Three of 12 meconium specimens from
   infants with proved CF gave false-negative results in all 3 tests.
   The other 9 specimens had greater than 100 mg albumin/g dry weight
   and albumin: alpha-1-trypsin inhibitor ratios of greater than 3.0; in
   subsequent faecal specimens the ratios were over 4.0. 176 meconium
   specimens from elsewhere in the UK were examined and these included
   23 from infants who were subsequently proved to have CF. Six of these
   23 CF specimens gave false-negative results, the other 17 being
   strongly positive. The origins of meconium serum protein suggest that
   infants with CF in whom meconium gives false-negative results have
   normal pancreatic functions at birth. The specificity of current
   meconium tests therefore cannot be improved as they depend on
   pancreatic dysfunction.

EX Wallwork and co-workers have proposed that increased absorption of
   antigens takes place across the mucosal membranes of the gut and
   respiratory tract possibly due to a transient defect in the
   production of secretory IgA.  As a consequence of this hypothesis,
   one would expect cystic fibrosis patients to produce a pronounced
   antibody response against the intestinal bacterial flora.  The
   present work was therefore carried out to investigate the antibody
   response in CF patients and in normal persons against Escherichia
   coli and Bacteroides fragilis which are present in the gut in large
   numbers and against the respiratory pathogen P. aeruginosa.  A
   significantly higher prevalence of precipitins against each of the 3
   bacterial species was found in CF patients compared to normal
   persons, and the prevalence of precipitins against each of these
   bacteria increased significantly with age.  As regards P. aeruginosa
   precipitins, the prevalence and number was significantly higher in CF
   patients who have subsequently succumbed compared to CF patients who
   are still alive.  Such a correlation between the antibody response
   and the prognosis of the patients was not found as regards E. coli or
   B. fragilis.  Considering the hypothesis of Wallwork and co-workers
   concerning increased absorption of antigens from the gut, it seems
   more attractive to suppose that increased absorption of antigens from
   the gut flora occurs predominantly in CF patients with P. aeruginosa
   lung infection with a pronounced antibody response against P.
   aeruginosa.

EX Since the Dresden Meeting in 1977 there have only been a few new
   developments of interest in special field of screening for cystic
   fibrosis.  There is no ideal screening test for CF available today.
   The BM Test Meconium is the test most widely used now but many
   technical, psychological and methodological problems remain to be
   solved before the test can be endorsed without reservation.

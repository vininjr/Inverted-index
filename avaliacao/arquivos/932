EX Malabsorption in infancy and childhood can roughly be defined as a
   condition of inadequate growth in spite of seemingly adequate
   nutrition and is accompanied by excessive excretion of food
   components in the stools.  Acquired lactase deficiency, the
   introduction of sugar in the diet, coeliac disease, and cystic
   fibrosis are discussed.

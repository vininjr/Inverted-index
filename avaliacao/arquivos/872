EX Intermittent epigastric pain, partially relieved by food, was the
   reason for examining the upper gastrointestinal tract in a
   30-year-old man.  The second portion of the duodenum was strikingly
   abnormal.  The patient had a history of daily, multiple loose stools
   since birth.  At age 12 a diagnosis of small bowel malabsorption due
   to fibrocystic disease of the pancreas was established.  In view of
   this history, the duodenal changes were considered to be a
   manifestation of fibrocystic disease of the pancreas.  At the present
   time the cause of these duodenal abnormalities is unknown.

EX The present study was initiated to determine the antibody response
   to lipoprotein of patients with various enterobacterial infections.
   This investigation was also considered important because patients
   with these infections respond differently to another antigen common
   to enterobacteriaceae, the common enterobacterial antigen.
   Included were 33 patients with cystic fibrosis, complicated by
   enterobacterial respiratory tract infection.  The lipoprotein (LP)
   antibody levels of healthy subjects and of patients with varied
   enterobacterial infections were determined.  None of the healthy
   children and only one of the healthy adults had antibodies against
   LP.  In contrast, 18% of the children with peritonitis complicating
   appendicitis, 24% of patients with enterobacterial infection of the
   respiratory tract complicating cystic fibrosis, and 42% of adult
   subjects with bacteremia complicating malignancy, had LP antibodies
   in the serum.  The reason for these striking differences in the
   immune response to this common antigen remains to be elucidated.

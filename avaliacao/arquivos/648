EX In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) of the pancreas, optic
   neuritis and peripheral neuritis have been reported to follow
   treatment with chloramphenicol.  This toxic sequel appears to be
   related to the dosage and duration of therapy.  In patients with
   other diseases who are treated with chloramphenicol, the risk of
   devastating bone marrow toxicity has been estimated to range from
   1:40,000 to 1:100,000.  We have found only two reports of patients
   with CF who had hematologic complications after treatment with
   chloramphenicol.  We here report a 3-year-old girl who had selective
   depression of the erythroid bone marrow, anorexia, weight loss,
   temporary hair loss and retardation of growth after prolonged
   administration of chloramphenicol.

AB The dietary problems associated with the care of chronically sick
   children can be considered under two broad headings.  First, there
   are the problems in those children for whom diet is an essential
   part of the treatment of their chronic disorder; and second there
   are nutritional complications which may occur in children with
   chronic diseases in which diet does not have a specific role in
   treatment, and is thus often neglected or considered only at a later
   stage of management.  Many of the problems are of course common to
   both situations.  This paper will review briefly some of the
   difficulties, illustrating these with specific examples; no attempt
   will be made to describe or discuss the treatment of any particular
   disorder.

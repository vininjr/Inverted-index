AB Acute and chronic respiratory disorders play a large role in the
   practitioner's daily care of infants, children, and adolescents.  To
   assist with the more sophisticated problems in these diseases, the
   Ohio Committee on Pulmonary Standards has established pediatric
   pulmonary care centers distributed over the State of Ohio.  Referral
   to these centers may be requested by the practicing physician.  To
   illustrate the validity of this concept, this article reviews the
   care given to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the improved
   prognosis for this disease entity, and the advantages of expertise
   and of centralized care.

AB The records of all children in the Tucson area diagnosed as having
   cystic fibrosis (CF) before the age of 12 months were reviewed to
   ascertain the prevalence of metabolic alkalosis as a major presenting
   manifestation of CF. Five of eleven infants (46%) in whom CF had been
   diagnosed between 1 and 12 months of age initially were seen with
   hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis unassociated with
   marked dehydration, hyperpyrexia, or major pulmonary and/or
   gastrointestinal symptoms. Two infants had repeated episodes of
   metabolic alkalosis; for one of these infants, both episodes of
   metabolic alkalosis occurred before the diagnosis of CF. It is
   postulated that chronic loss of sweat electrolytes together with mild
   gastrointestinal or respiratory illness may predispose the infant
   with cystic fibrosis to a severe electrolyte and acid-base
   disturbance. The lack of shock and hyperpyrexia together with the
   apparent chronicity of electrolyte losses differentiates metabolic
   alkalosis from the heat prostration syndrome, a more acute
   complication of cystic fibrosis. Quantitative sweat testing should be
   part of the evaluation of any infant with unexplained metabolic
   alkalosis. Serum electrolytes should be assessed regularly in infants
   with cystic fibrosis during hot weather months.

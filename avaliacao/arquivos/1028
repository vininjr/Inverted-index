EX One of the symptoms of cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) is pancreatic
   insufficiency.  The reduced proteolytic activity in the gut of
   children with the disease results in an elevated concentration of
   protein, especially serum albumin, in the meconium.  This feature is
   used in the diagnosis of the disease in the newborn, and we decided
   to examine the utility of enzyme immunoassay for the measurement of
   albumin in meconium samples from normal and cystic fibrosis infants.
   Normal samples were found to have apparent albumin concentrations in
   the range 0.05-0.26 mg/g dry wt., whereas cystic fibrosis samples had
   concentrations in the range 60-230 mg/g dry wt.  The assay provides a
   cheap and relatively rapid method of differentiating cystic fibrosis
   positive and negative meconium samples.

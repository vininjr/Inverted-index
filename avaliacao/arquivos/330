EX The manifestations of cystic fibrosis make it a complex disease, in
   the management of which the respiratory physician, the
   microbiologist, the gastroenterologist and last but not least, the
   psychologist, all are or should be involved.  About 1 in 10 babies
   with cystic fibrosis are born with acute intestinal obstruction due
   to plugging of the small intestine with very sticky meconium.
   Diagnosis is made by the test for excess salt in the sweat, and
   although possible very soon after birth, it is easier to carry out at
   about three weeks of age when the baby sweats more freely.  The great
   majority of children, if not treated, tend to suffer progressively
   more frequent chest infections or chronic chest infections.  The
   reason for the tendency of the lungs of children with cystic fibrosis
   to become colonised by harmful bacteria is not known.  Most cystic
   fibrosis children absorb carbohydrate normally, but only about 50%
   (range 45% to 80%) of the protein and fats they eat.  The only other
   major problem for which any active measures may be required is the
   occurrence of fibrosis of the liver in about 5% of these children.
   Children with cystic fibrosis should be brought up from the beginning
   to be like other children.

EX Although constipation is not well defined, when it is brought to the
   attention of a physician, it should raise certain questions.  In a
   newborn, is obstipation due to Hirschsprung's disease, meconium
   ileus, or intermittent volvulus?  Is obstipation in a child with a
   mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus
   equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient
   have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the
   child constipated for psychogenic reasons?  All of us who deal with
   children should consider all of these entities in each of our
   patients, so as not to miss those several diseases with grave but
   preventable consequences.

AB Since it has been demonstrated that chronic administration of
   reserpine to rats produces CF-like alterations, we have studied the
   lung resistance to bacterial infections in animals treated with
   reserpine.  Mice of the BALB/c inbred strain were injected
   subcutaneously with different doses of reserpine for 7 days; after,
   they were submitted to an infective aerosol containing
   Staphylococcus aureus in a nebulization chamber.  With each pair of
   exposed animals, an individual value of the uncleared bacteria ratio
   (UBR) at 4 hours was obtained.  Reserpinized animals showed a
   significant increase in UBR values when compared to control mice (p
   < 0.05 and p < 0.01 depending on the doses), suggesting an
   impairment of the lung antibacterial defenses.  Although
   pharmacological doses of reserpine produce catecholamine depletion,
   we can not conclude that this action upon the nervous system is the
   only cause of the CF-like response we detected.  In conclusion, the
   observed UBR decrease lends support to the concept of a reserpine-
   induced CF animal model.

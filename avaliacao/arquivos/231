AB From 39 normal children and 36 patients, suffering from cystic
   fibrosis (C/F), the copper content of finger nail clippings and toe
   nail clippings were determined. From this study it can be concluded
   that, although the patients with cystic fibrosis (C/F) have a higher
   copper content, the determination of copper in nail samples cannot be
   used in order to differentiate between normal children and patients.
   Also higher mean copper concentrations were found in finger nail
   clippings in comparison with toe nails. This difference was
   significant for patients with cystic fibrosis.

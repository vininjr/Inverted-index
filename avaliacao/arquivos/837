EX Bronchiectasis is characterised by dilatation of the bronchi.  This
   dilation may be generalised or confined to a single segment or lobe
   of the lung, and it may be tubular, fusiform (spindle shaped), or
   saccular (cystic).  The aetiology, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment,
   complications, and prevention of bronchiectasis are considered.
   Cystic fibrosis affects many exocrine glands throughout the body.
   Presentation and diagnosis, treatment, complications and their
   treatment, management of associated social problems, and death due to
   cystic fibrosis are discussed.

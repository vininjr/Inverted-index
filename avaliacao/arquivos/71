EX Cord serum, amniotic fluid and meconium of a newborn from a
   heterozygote (PiZZ) mother were investigated.  In the newborn infant
   the diagnosis of homozygote (PiZZ) deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin
   could be established in cord serum at the time of delivery.  Trypsin
   inhibitory capacity (TIC) and alpha1-antitrypsin (AT) in cord serum
   were in the range of adult homozygotes.  By means of crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis exclusively, the phenotypic alleles ZZ were
   demonstrable.  This excludes the possibility of materno-fetal
   transfer of alpha1-antitrypsin.  In infant amniotic fluid extremely
   low antiprotease-activity and substantially no alpha1-antitrypsin was
   found, whereas in normal samples the TIC is 3% to 6% of the cord
   serum values and the AT 1.2% to 4% of cord serum concentration.  Our
   data suggest that a major component of TIC and AT in normal amniotic
   fluid derive from the fetus.  In normal meconium we detected TIC and
   AT in concentrations increasing proportionally to the total protein
   content.  The inhibitory capacity of AT in meconium expressed in mg
   trypsin inhibited per mg alpha1-antitrypsin however is 80% less than
   serum alpha1-antitrypsin.  No correlation exists with the free
   tryptic activity of meconium.  The AT of an PiZZ infant is clearly
   diminished when referred to fresh weight, whereas meconia from three
   cystic fibrosis newborns screened by the BM test had extremely high
   concentrations.  Estimation of TIC and AT in meconium is regarded as
   a useful approach for screening on homozygote alpha1-antitrypsin
   deficiency.  The exact diagnosis however can only be established by
   phenotyping the alleles.  In cystic fibrosis the high protein content
   of meconium is accompanied by increased alpha1-antitrypsin levels.

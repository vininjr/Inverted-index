AB Acute pseudomonas infections require treatment with antibiotics
   producing a bactericidal effect. The most useful are gentamicin,
   tobramycin, sisomicin and polymyxin B. In resistant strains, amikacin
   is indicated in addition. Carbenicillin, ticarcillin, carfenicillin
   or azocillin should never be given alone but in combination with some
   of the above preparations. Other drugs, such as chloramphenicol,
   tetracycline or streptomycin, though effective in vitro, should be
   avoided. Chemotherapy may be complemented by passive immunization
   either with hyperimmune specific gama globulin or hyperimmune plasma.
   A programmatic item of combined treatment is active immunization,
   especially with toxoid vaccine. Chronic processes are not, perhaps
   with the exception of urinary infections, suitable for antibiotic
   therapy. For this reason effective polyvalent vaccines should be
   developed from appropriate strains. It is now certain that in
   infections caused by mucous strains (most frequently encountered in
   cystic fibrosis) the vaccine should be prepared from these strains,
   since they have distinct functional and antigenic characteristics.

AB Cell-free culture medium from PHA-stimulated PBL cultures or
   long-term lymphoid cell lines from CF homozygotes or obligate
   heterozygotes, as well as serum from such individuals, can produce
   three distinct changes in the ciliary beat of rabbit tracheal
   ciliated epithelium: (1) increased beat frequency, (2) CD, and (3)
   ciliostasis.  The ability to produce both 1 and 2 seems to be
   characteristic for leukocyte cultures from CF genotypes: 46 of 49 CF
   cultures produced both effects, as compared with none of 16 cultures
   from normal controls and 1 of 10 from non-CF patient controls with
   bronchial asthma.  CTA was not specific for CF PBL cultures, since
   13% of normal control and 60% of the non-CF patient control cultures
   produced ciliostasis.  Similar findings were obtained when serum from
   the same individuals or culture medium from long-term lymphoid cell
   lines was tested.  Using protein A from Staphylococcus aureus
   covalently coupled to Sepharose CL-4B as a reagent, we separated the
   CDAs present in serum and in culture medium from PBL and lymphoid
   cultures.  Protein A specifically adsorbs IgG and binds it under mild
   conditions at physiological pH.  The CDAs are noncovalently bound to
   IgG at physiological pH and can be co-purified with IgG.  The IgG-CDA
   complexes can be readily desorbed from protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at
   pH 3.0, and under these conditions the CDAs are dissociated from IgG,
   retain all their activity, and can be separated by chromatography on
   Bio-Gel P-10 or Sephadex G-200.  Three distinct activities were
   removed from serum or PBL cultures which showed both CDA and CTA, and
   two were obtained from samples which showed only CDA.  One CDA
   believed to be specific for CF (CF-CDA) was separated from CF serum
   and PBL or lymphoid cell culture medium.  This CF-CDA was complexed
   noncovalently to IgG (not subclass IgG3), had a molecular weight of
   4000 to 6000, was stable as acid pH, was found in biological fluids
   from both homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF, was shown not to be
   C3a (anaphylatoxin), did not require IgG for activity, and was
   positively charged at pH values more acidic than 8.0.

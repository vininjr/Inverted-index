EX Our patient had well-compensated and late-appearing cystic fibrosis
   manifested by moderately decreased exercise, tolerance and a normal
   semen analysis, and he had presumably fathered one child.  It is
   important to again emphasize the physician's obligation to determine
   fertility in any male cystic fibrosis patient, particularly with
   late-onset of symptoms, and to provide appropriate genetic
   counseling.

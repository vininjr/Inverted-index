AB Serum glutathione reductase (NADPH-GSSG oxidoreductase, EC. 1.6.4.2
   (GR)) has been examined in cystic fibrosis subjects (CF), obligate CF
   heterozygotes, and control subjects. Serum protein concentration was
   similar in the three groups. Regardless of the units used to express
   activity (milligrams of protein or milliliters of serum) or whether or
   not samples were dialyzed against water or phosphate buffer, mean
   serum GR in CF was greater than in control subjects (P less than or
   equal to 0.002) in all series over several years. Under the above
   assay conditions no difference in serum GR between control subjects
   and carriers was detected. Calculated and assayed values of combined
   control and CF sera agreed as did expected and observed 50% activity
   in 1:2 sera dilutions in CF, control subjects, and carriers. Addition
   of FAD to incubation media did not effect enzyme activity in the
   three groups. Differences between CF and control subjects persisted
   after dialysis in membranes permitting passage of molecules of
   approximately 12,000 mol wt or less. These findings would tend to
   exclude the effect of extraneous serum factors in explaining the
   differences between CF and control subjects. The percentage of
   initial GR activity after four days storage (0-4 degrees) was
   significantly greater in CF than in control subjects (P less than
   0.025). The effect of heparin on serum GR was recorded as the
   percentage of activity after incubation with heparin vs. activity in
   the standard assay for individual subjects. The effect of incubation
   with 5 mug/ml heparin on serum GR activity was greater in control
   subjects than in carriers (P less than 0.0005) and CF (P less than
   0.0005). Mean serum GR activity in CF and carriers was unaffected by
   heparin, whereas mean activity in control subjects was decreased. In
   no control was the percentage of initial activity with heparin
   greater than the mean of CF and carrier groups. Only 3 of 20 CF and 4
   of 20 carrier individuals had percentages lower than the control
   mean. The CF and carrier distributions were clearly different from
   the control distribution. Serum GR was determined in seven non-CF
   individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Activity in the COPD was different from CF and no different from
   control subjects. In none of these controls or COPD was serum GR as
   great as the CF mean. Serum GR in no CF was as low as the mean of
   control subjects or COPD. It is concluded that serum GR activity is
   greater in CF than in control subjects, carriers, and non-CF COPD
   subjects; that the difference in activity is not attributable to an
   extraneous serum factor, that the activity difference is not
   secondary to chronic respiratory disease; that in comparison with
   control subjects, GR from CF serum behaves differently after storage;
   and that serum GR from CF and carriers behaves differently from
   control GR in the presence of heparin.

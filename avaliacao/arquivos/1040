EX We have found patients who have cystic fibrosis to be very special
   people; they have to overcome apparently insurmountable odds.  Our
   teaching program comes from a basic belief that with support,
   encouragement and affection, information and a focus on the positive
   aspects of life, a person with CF can live well, even if only one
   breath at a time.

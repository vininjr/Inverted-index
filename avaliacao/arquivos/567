AB Fibroblasts derived from cystic fibrosis homozygotes and
   heterozygotes were compared to normal fibroblasts topologically,
   ultrastructurally, and microchemically. Topological examinations, by
   means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed no significant
   differences between the 3 genotypes surveyed. The cells were
   generally flattened and/or fusiform structures that were more or less
   devoid of surface details. However, the dividing cells, in all of the
   populations surveyed, were found to have a more or less spherical
   configuration involving a highly complicated surface. The surface
   manifestations included blebs, ridges, and microvilli. Representative
   samples of the cells in all stages of growth, lag phase, exponential
   phase, and plateau phase, were surveyed in this study.
   Ultrastructurally, the fibroblasts of the 3 genotypes were found to
   have similar cytological detail. Highly infolded nuclei, distinct
   organelle components, and surface details, also seen in the SEM
   study, were observed. Numerous bundles of microfilaments were noted
   within the cytoplasm. Metachromatic granules were observed in cells
   from all 3 genotypes. Microchemical analysis, by means of energy
   dispersive X-ray analysis, demonstrated slight but recognizable
   differences in the elemental composition of the 3 genotypes. Of
   notable interest were the peak intensities of calcium and sulfur. The
   CF homozygous cells presented higher values for both of the elements
   when compared to the values observed in the CF heterozygous and
   normal cell populations. Although consistent differences could be
   observed in the CF genotypes when compared to the non-CF cells, no
   attempt was made to quantitate the concentrations of each of the
   elements within the cells.

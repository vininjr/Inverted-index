AB Salivary amylase levels were determined in normal subjects from
   birth until adult life and in children with conditions sometimes
   associated with low pancreatic amylase such as malnutrition, coeliac
   disease and cystic fibrosis.  Mixed saliva was collected under
   carefully standardised conditions and amylase was measured by the
   method of Dahlqvist.  There was a wide scatter of values in the 84
   normal subjects, but concentrations rose from very low levels at
   birth to reach adult levels by the age of 6 months to 1 year.
   Salivary amylase activity rose normally over ten weeks in one
   premature infant fed milk by gastrostomy.  Thirteen children with
   coeliac disease and 9 children with cystic fibrosis mostly had
   normal salivary amylase concentrations.  Six out of 12 malnourished
   children with jejunal villous atrophy of uncertain aetiology had low
   levels which rose to normal as recovery began.

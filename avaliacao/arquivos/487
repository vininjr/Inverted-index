EX An outbreak of salmonellosis in patients consuming pancreatin in the
   U.K. prompted a study at this hospital which included determination
   of the infecting dose in children with cystic fibrosis known to have
   contracted a S. schwarzengrund enteritis from contaminated porcine
   powdered pancreatin.  We found that infection was especially
   prevalent in very young cystic-fibrosis patients who were receiving
   broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment for chest infection.  All had
   their pancreatin added to meals immediately before consumption.
   Susceptibility to most infections depends on many factors and
   variables.  It is necessary to take into account such things as age
   and condition of the patient when discussing the actual number of
   organisms causing an infection.

AB The concentrations of nine plasma proteins were determined by
   quantitative immunoelectrophoresis in sputum specimens from 29
   patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and from 24 patients with severe
   asthma and chronic bronchitis. The results suggested that the
   population of CF patients could be divided into two groups in spite
   of an absence of difference in clinical status between the groups.
   Average concentrations of seven plasma proteins in sputum of group I
   CF patients were identical with those in sputum of patients with
   bronchitis, but the average concentrations of six of these proteins
   in sputum from group II CF patients were higher than those in
   specimens from the bronchitic patients and were similar to
   corresponding concentrations in sputum from patients with asthma, all
   of whom were examined while in status asthmaticus. The average
   concentrations of 14 secretory proteins were the same in all sputum
   specimens whether or not they were produced by patients with cystic
   fibrosis, asthma or bronchitis. It was concluded that the
   concentrations in the bronchopulmonary secretions of proteins
   associated with host defence were not diminished in patients with
   cystic fibrosis, and failure to produce adequate concentrations of
   proteins with antimicrobial activity was unlikely to be responsible
   for the above average susceptibility to chest infection in cystic
   fibrosis. It is suggested that there exists a group of CF patients in
   whom a pulmonary allergic reaction generates an inflammatory response
   as severe as that characterizing status asthmaticus and that this
   response could be detrimental.

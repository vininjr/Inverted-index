AB The results of open thoractomy and pleurectomy or pleural abrasion
   for 17 episodes of pneumothorax in patients with cystic fibrosis were
   compared with the results of observation, closed thoracostomy, and
   closed thoracostomy with sclerosing agents. Open thoracotomy had the
   advantage of insuring prompt resolution of the pneumothorax. A small
   incision minimized postoperative morbidity. The average hospital stay
   was 15 days after open thoracotomy and 19 days after closed
   thoracostomy, with or without sclerosing agents. Complications of all
   treatments were infrequent. A limited symptomatic recurrence was
   observed in 2 of 17 pneumothoraces successfully treated with open
   thoracotomy. Recurrence also occurred in 1 of 8 treated with
   observation, 3 of 9 treated with closed thoracostomy, and 1 of 14
   treated with closed thoracostomy and sclerosing agents. A loss of
   vital capacity was usually noted 4 to 18 months after resolution,
   regardless of treatment. Forty per cent of patients in both operative
   and nonoperative groups survived 3 years. In our experience, open
   thoracotomy can be used safely for treatment of unresolved or
   recurrent pneumothorax and warrants further evaluation as a primary
   therapy for pneumothorax in patients with cystic fibrosis.

EX We agree with the comment of Dr Feighery and Mr Woods that a low
   migration index signifies sensitivity to an antigen which can be
   achieved only by functionally active immunocompetent cells.  However,
   we must emphasise that the functions of active immunocompetent cells
   may or may not be impaired, depending upon the antigens to which such
   cells are sensitised.  Since comparative cells from age-matched
   controls and from blood donors did not show such sensitisation to
   those antigens to which the cystic fibrosis cells were sensitised
   then there is no doubt that the normal function of these
   immunocompetent cells in the patients with CF is indeed impaired.
   When one considers that steroids are known immunosuppressants it is
   certainly not surprising that treatment of the CF patients with
   prednisolone caused a decreased sensitivity of these sensitised CF
   cells to the antigens.  Indeed, therapeutic concentrations of
   steroids were able to reduce the ability of sensitised spleen cells
   and of lymph-node cells to destroy target cells in vitro.  Apart from
   this inhibition of sensitised cells by steroids, 90% of sensitised
   lymphocytes were killed when prednisolone 1 mg/l was present during
   the sensitisation phase.  In addition it was observed in man that if
   cortisol or prednisolone was given two hours before abrading the
   skin, then there occurred a marked reduction of emigrations of both
   mononuclear cells and polymorphs into the area, thus inhibiting the
   mobilisation of macrophages.  We believe that the situation with
   regard to steroid therapy and inhibition of migration of leukocytes
   from CF patients is similar.

AB Static lung volumes (VC, TLC, FRC, RV), elastic recoil pressure of
   the lungs (Pst(1) at 100, 90, and 60% of TLC), static lung compliance
   [Cst(1)], specific airway conductance at FRC level (Gaw/TGVex),
   forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), maximal
   expiratory flows (Vmax.) at 25 and 50% of VC and at 60% of TLC, and
   "upstream" airway conductance (Gus) at 60% of TLC were studied in 28
   patients with cystic fibrosis, 5 to 25 years old, over a period of 1
   to 5 years. The data were compared individually with normal values,
   related to body height in the form of regression equations and
   expressed in percentage of predicted values. From the indices
   assessing airway function, Vmax. at low lung volumes, Gus at 60% TLC,
   RV and RV/TLC were the functional parameters most consistently
   abnormal. Among the indices characterizing lung elasticity, Pst(1) at
   60% TLC was the most abnormal. Generally, the values of the majority
   of lung function indices [VC, TLC, FRC, Pst(1)] declined during
   growth. Vmax. at all lung volumes and Gus at 60% TLC did not
   deteriorate with growth probably due to the great abnormality of
   these parameters already in young patients. It was also observed that
   lung function did not change significantly over a period of 1 to 5
   years corresponding to a 10 cm increase in body height. However, over
   that period, lung function improved in some of the subjects, did not
   change in over 50% of the cases and deteriorated in the others.

EX The initial roentgenograms of 178 consecutive newly diagnosed
   patients with cystic fibrosis seen during the past five years were
   reviewed to determine the presence of fatty liver.  Seven cases of
   visibly fatty liver were identified.  The incidence of visibly fatty
   liver on the initial roentgenograms in newly diagnosed cases of
   cystic fibrosis was 4%.  The cause of fatty infiltration of the
   liver in cystic fibrosis is not clear; however, the basis is most
   likely a nutritional deficiency in protein.

EX Ten years ago, we demonstrated that chronic administration of
   isoproterenol to rats results is structural and functional changes of
   their salivary glands similar to those seen in exocrine glands of
   patients with cystic fibrosis.  Recently, we began to study the
   cellular pathophysiology of these glands and managed to achieve
   pharmacological control of this abnormality.  We demonstrated that
   administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist in these animals
   resulted in the correction of the electrolyte abnormality which is
   very similar to that seen in the sweat glands of patients with cystic
   fibrosis.  These two examples of manipulation of the secretory
   processes in exocrine glands of experimental animals demonstrate the
   feasibility of this approach in the therapy of patients with cystic
   fibrosis.

AB Bioassays using ciliary systems have detected a factor or factors in
   cystic fibrosis (CF) sera and tissue culture medium derived from CF
   cells. The typical shortcomings of an assay measuring biological
   activity have been studied, and the means to overcome the weaknesses
   of the oyster gill cilia assay have been established. The presence of
   the cystic fibrosis mucociliary inhibitor (CFMI) in experimental
   fractions may be determined by accepting data from only those assays
   in which authentic CF and normal (non-CF) fractions give defined
   reactions, by measuring the reaction of each sample at least three
   times, and by examining each experimental sample at a protein
   concentration greater than the minimum established in this study. The
   relative concentrations of the CFMI present in the first steps of
   purification of serum and medium have been calculated in terms of
   units of inhibition. Generally, the units of inhibition present in
   serum and medium fractions from heterozygotes are close to one-half
   of that in fractions from homozygous sources. Analogous fractions
   concentrated from a normal (non-CF) source never inhibited
   mucociliary activity, even when tested at nearly 100 times the CF
   concentration. Ciliary assays utilizing oyster gills are essential
   for monitoring fractionation procedures aimed at purifying the CFMI,
   and have been shown to be capable and reliable enough to do so.

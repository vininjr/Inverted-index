AB The serum from 75% of the patients with cystic fibrosis (C.F.) who
   had a positive prick test in their skin to at least one or more
   antigens, together with elevated concentrations of total serum IgE,
   also gave strong immediate PCA reactions in the baboon skin to
   Aspergillus fumigatus, bovine serum albumin and egg albumin.  Of the
   C.F. patients, 37% also had elevated serum specific IgE to A.
   fumigatus whereas only 8-10% had either raised specific IgE or PCA
   reaction to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.  Abolition of the PCA
   activity by incubating the C.F. sera or sputum at 56 degrees C
   suggested that the reaginic antibody was IgE rather than IgG4.  PCA
   reactions to a number of allergens could be detected in both the
   C.F. sputum and saliva.  Several of the C.F. heterozygotes had a
   strongly positive history of allergy and a significant number of
   these heterozygotes had an elevated serum total IgE as well as
   positive PCA to Timothy grass pollen or to D. pteronyssinus similar
   to the patients with asthma or hay fever.  Three C.F. patients who
   died gave strong prick test reactions to several allergens and their
   sera also had raised serum IgE and positive PCA to at least three
   different allergens, suggesting that immediate hypersensitivity is
   of some significance in patients with C.F.

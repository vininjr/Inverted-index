EX For some time now we have been using a screening test for cystic
   fibrosis based on levels of stool trypsin and chymotrypsin on the
   fourth day of life.  One interesting observation is the number of
   premature babies who have little or no pancreatic trypsin or
   chymotrypsin at this time.  For example, of the babies tested from
   St. Helen's Maternity Hospital between June, 1974, and April, 1975,
   84 were classified as premature in the birth-records book.  Samples
   were received for only 65 of these babies.  Of these 65 babies, 26
   (40%) had stool-trypsin levels of <100 microg. per g. compared with
   only 2.5% of the other babies tested during this period.  As may be
   expected, the lower-birth-weight babies tend to have lower
   stool-enzyme concentrations.  We feel that our data indicate that at
   least some premature babies would benefit from pancreatic-enzyme
   supplementation or predigested foods in the first few days after
   birth.

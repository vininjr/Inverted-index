EX As far as rabbit alveolar macrophages are concerned,
   the concentration of homozygous CF serum used in our experiments
   was even greater than the fourfold concentration which Biggar and
   associates state was required for normal phagocytosis.  Increasing
   dilutions of homozygous CF sera with either Hanks balanced salt
   solution or normal human serum, thus decreasing its concentration,
   increased the capacity of the rabbit alveolar macrophages to
   phagocytize and kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Increasing
   concentrations had just the opposite effect.  Suspension of rabbit
   alveolar macrophages in human serum reduced their phagocytic
   activity, but activity was reduced more by human CF serum than by
   human normal serum.  This is not unexpected because high human
   serum concentrations are likely to be toxic to rabbit alveolar
   macrophages.  Because the inhibition of phagocytosis was absent
   when homozygous CF serum more than 24 hours old or previously
   heated or frozen was used and because of our observations that
   dilution increased macrophage phagocytic ability, we feel our data
   demonstrate the presence of a labile inhibitor rather than a
   deficiency.  Since it is well known that CF patients have normal
   or elevated concentrations of immunoglobulins including IgA in
   their sera and pulmonary secretions and respond to infection, and
   IgA has not been shown to be essential for alveolar macrophage
   phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we cannot agree that this
   inhibition is due to an IgA deficiency.  We also note that some of
   the sera used in the experiments of Biggar and associates were
   stored at -70 degrees C.  Perhaps this may account for the
   difference in results.

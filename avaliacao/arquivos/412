AB An increased number of 'fast isoamylases' is found in the parotid
   saliva of children with cystic fibrosis and their heterozygous
   parents who are clinically healthy. 'Fast isoamylases' are generated,
   at least in part, from the 6 isoamylases of the basic pattern by
   deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues. This basic pattern
   is present in the parotid saliva of all subjects we have tested so
   far. A shift in the equilibrium between amidation and deamidation
   processes is discussed in terms of its possible significance for the
   pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis and for ageing.

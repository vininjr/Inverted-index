AB This article reports on the possibility of using instrumental
   neutron activation analysis (INAA) of sodium in nail clippings for
   diagnosing cystic fibrosis (CF) in children and adults, for
   detecting heterozygotes and for screening in the neonatal period.
   Nail clippings from 1322 newborns, 22 CF patients (two of them
   newborns), 52 healthy controls and 22 heterozygotes were analyzed.
   The discrimination between CF patients and controls was found to be
   precise for individuals above one year of age and INAA of nail
   clippings should be accepted as a diagnostic test for CF after this
   age.  Heterozygotes could not be detected by the method.  During the
   first five days of life there is a big overlap between the values
   from normal newborns and those of CF children, which makes the
   method invaluable for early screening for CF.

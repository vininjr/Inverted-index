AB Ultrastructural analysis including scanning and transmission electron
   microscopic studies (SEM and TEM) were carried out on oyster gill
   tissue after exposure either to serum fractions from individuals
   homozygous or heterozygous for cystic fibrosis (CF), to comparable
   serum fractions from normal individuals, or to sea water. In 4 of the
   experiments examined topologically (SEM), the CF sera (either
   heterozygous or homozygous) stimulated the production of mucus that
   was found in close association with the cilia. The association of
   excessive mucus with the cell surface could be responsible, in part,
   for the well-known inhibition of ciliary activity by a factor in CF
   serum. In 3 additional SEM experiments involving shorter treatment
   times, very little difference could be observed between homozygous
   CF, heterozygous CF, and normal serum-fraction-treated oyster
   tissues. In parallel experiments, ultrathin sections of gill tissue
   were examined by means of TEM. Those samples that were responsive, as
   determined by TEM, displayed several characteristic features,
   including enlarged and partially exuded goblet cells, altered mucus
   structure along with twisted and matted cilia. An overall swelling of
   the gill filament was also observed in the responsive tissues. From
   TEM analysis no detectable alteration in fine structure was apparent
   in gill tissues that were treated with sera from heterozygous or
   normal individuals.

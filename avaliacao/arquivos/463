AB In cystic fibrosis there is chronic infection and inflammatory
   reaction in the airways, accompanied by destruction and shedding of
   airway epithelium. Leukocytes migrate into the airways and some
   disintegrate, liberating deoxyribonucleoprotein that is incorporated
   into the gel structure of the bronchial mucus. We compared the status
   of these processes in cystic fibrosis with that in chronic bronchitis
   and bronchiectasis, by examining the sputum raised from the lower
   airways. Measurements also were made on sputum induced in normal
   subjects. The results indicate that migration of leukocytes into the
   airways and shedding of damaged airway epithelium were minimal in the
   normal subjects; they were significant in the patients with chronic
   bronchitis, higher in those with bronchiectasis, and still higher in
   those with cystic fibrosis. The large increases found in the total
   content of DNA and solids in the cystic fibrosis sputum were due to
   increases in the insoluble fraction containing the whole leukocytes
   and particulate debris that remained when the sputum mucus gel was
   solubilized with mercaptoethanol. Despite the large increases in the
   total content of DNA and solids, the contents of mucus gel components
   and of deoxyribonucleoprotein from disintegrated leukocytes actually
   present in the mucus gel structure of the cystic fibrosis sputum were
   not significantly higher than in the sputum from the patients with
   chronic bronchitis or brochiectasis.

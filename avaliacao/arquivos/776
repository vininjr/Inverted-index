AB Cystic fibrosis (C.F.) is a serious genetic disorder occurring
   mainly among the Whites and starting in early childhood or even at
   birth.  The name is a shortening of the old term Cystic Fibrosis (or
   Fibrocystic disease) of the pancreas.  This comes from the
   historical appearance at post-mortem first described by Landsteiner
   in 1905.  It was only in 1938 that Dorothee Anderson and Fanconi
   realised that the disease was a separate entity and not simply a
   manifestation of other illnesses.  Another name is Mucoviscidosis
   which gives a clue as to one of the most important features of the
   disease.  Mucus formed is thicker and stickier (more viscid) than
   normal and tends to clog up the bronchi and ducts, particularly the
   pancreatic ducts.  Chronic bronchitis with recurrent severe
   infection and malabsorption are the main symptoms of the disease.
   The other important abnormality is an increased amount of sodium
   chloride (salt) in the sweat.  This fact, used in the diagnosis, was
   first realised during a heat wave in New York in 1953 when it was
   noticed that most of the children with heat prostration suffered
   from C.F.  Little is known of the causes of the abnormalities of
   sweat and mucus.  Some generalised cell abnormality (? enzymatic)
   seems possible.  There is no doubt that the condition is genetically
   transmitted and most evidence favours a recessive mode of
   inheritance.

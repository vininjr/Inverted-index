EX The article by Dr Warner and colleagues may be of great significance
   to our understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of cystic
   fibrosis (C.F.), and accords with our observations that allergic
   symptoms and positive skin tests are more common in C.F. homozygotes
   than in healthy controls.  Apart from the fact that 59% of our C.F.
   homozygotes gave a positive skin test to one or more of 40 different
   classes of Bencard antigens, the main one being Aspergillus
   fumigatus, at least 85% of the C.F. heterozygotes had a strong
   positive history of allergy, of which the mother and her maternal
   progenitors, followed by the siblings, accounted for most.  Further
   studies are required to establish the relationship, if any, between
   the gene responsible for the allergic manifestation in the population
   and the C.F. phenotype.

AB The distribution of serological types of D. pneumoniae was
   investigated in 40 strains isolated from 26 children with cystic
   fibrosis and 57 strains isolated from 39 children with other
   diseases. All strains were isolated from sputum or tracheal
   secretion. The strains from cystic fibrosis patients belonged to 14
   different serological types, the most prevalent were 19F, 19A and 3.
   The strains from the other group of children belonged to 20 different
   serological types, the most prevalent were 23F, 19F and 11A. The
   differences between the two groups of patients as to the prevalences
   of types were small, and it is concluded that no special serological
   types of D. pneumoniae are associated with cystic fibrosis.

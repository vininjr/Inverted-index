AB Proteolytic activity, defined as the hydrolysis of peptide bonds
   involving the carboxyl group of L-arginine, in plasma of patients
   with cystic fibrosis, heterozygotes, and control subjects has been
   assayed using a fluorometric method with protamine as the substrate
   and fluorescamine as the reagent. The mean total proteolytic activity
   in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis was approximately one-half
   the mean total activity in control subjects and heterozygotes. The
   mean proteolytic activity inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor in
   plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis was approximately one-third
   that of control subjects and heterozygotes. The relationship of
   arginine esterase activity to proteolytic activity was investigated.
   The pH optimum and action of reversible and irreversible inhibitors
   were similar for both activities, suggesting that the arginine
   esterase activity and proteolytic activity represent similar
   catalytic entities. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis
   that the basic defect in cystic fibrosis may reside in the deficiency
   of a proteolytic enzyme which results in the accumulation of the
   various cationic macromolecular "factors" described by other
   investigators in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis. The
   demonstration of a deficiency of proteolytic activity as assayed by
   the hydrolysis of protamine, a cationic polypeptide, could explain
   the presence of ciliotoxic cationic protein or polypeptide factors in
   serum of patients with cystic fibrosis and may, in some unknown
   manner, be related to the clinical manifestations of the disease.

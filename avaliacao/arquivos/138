AB No differences were found in the methylation of total nucleic acids,
   total RNA, DNA, tRNA, or rRNA from lymphocytes or fibroblasts
   obtained from normal subjects, obligate heterozygotes, or
   individuals with cystic fibrosis.  Similar results were obtained
   using four methods for isolation of the nucleic acids.  The reasons
   for the failure of two laboratories to discern the reported
   variations in methylation of RNA in the normal, carrier, or cystic
   fibrosis state may be obscure differences in culture conditions or
   conditions of extraction.

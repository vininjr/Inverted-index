EX Cystic Fibrosis (fibrocystic disease of the pancreas) is a common
   inherited disease which, to date, still has a fatal outcome.  The
   diversity of clinical manifestations and pathological findings has
   added further to the mysterious nature of the disease, as have the
   tantalizingly conflicting results of biochemical, physical and
   experimental studies in many laboratories of the western world.  One
   of the most constant clinical observations is the viscosity of the
   secretion of the mucosal glands in the respiratory and alimentary
   tracts, in the ducts of the biliary system and in the pancreas.  In
   approximately 10 to 15 per cent of all patients with cystic fibrosis
   of the pancreas the earliest manifestation, meconium ileus, occurs in
   the neonatal period.  In the remaining 85 to 90 per cent of affected
   infants the symptoms generally become evident within the course of
   the first year of life.  The lung symptoms tend to dominate the
   clinical picture in the vast majority of untreated patients and will
   ultimately decide the outcome.  The lower respiratory tract is not
   the only part involved: nasal polyps and the accumulation of viscous
   secretions in the paranasal sinuses with subsequent bacterial
   infection are not unusual.  Pancreatic deficiency is present in the
   vast majority of patients with cystic fibrosis and consists of a
   gross reduction or complete absence of exocrine secretion.  Although
   some histological damage has been seen in the neonatal period in
   infants suffering from meconium ileus, in general the full-blown
   picture of extensive cirrhosis, with portal hypertension,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and severe and sometimes fatal haemorrhages from
   oesophageal varices, is seen in the older child and adolescent.
   Screening of the newborn to enable the institution of protective
   measures before lung complications arise has been attempted with
   various techniques.  Management includes diet and pancreatic enzyme
   replacement.  The treatment of pulmonary disease is the most
   important aspect of care in patients with cystic fibrosis, and its
   prevention is priority number one in the over-all management.  The
   outlook for the child born with cystic fibrosis depends to a large
   extent upon the avoidance, or delay until adult life, of the two
   complications that threaten his existence: cor pulmonale and
   cirrhosis of the liver.

EX This study examined whether biologic activation of C3 with subsequent
   pulmonary inflammation takes place in the lungs of patients with
   cystic fibrosis.  Plasma complement C3 levels were all normal.
   Eleven of the patients with the C3 split product C3c were from the
   group of 14 patients suffering from chronic infection with mucoid
   strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2 were from the group of 14 CF
   patients without P. aeruginosa infection.  This difference was
   significant (p < 0.002).  A comparison of albumin ratios between the
   13 patients with the C3 split product C3c and the remaining other 15
   patients showed a significant higher ratio in the former group (p <
   0.01) on an average 4.1 versus 1.4 per cent.  The significantly
   higher albumin ratio demonstrated in the patients with C3c in their
   sputum sol phase supports the concept of complement-induced
   inflammation with subsequent transudation of plasma proteins in these
   patients.  This study thus shows that complement-mediated
   inflammatory reactions may play an important role in the pathogenesis
   of pulmonary tissue damage in patients with CF, even when the plasma
   C3 levels are normal, and it supports the concept of chronic P.
   aeruginosa lung infection as an immune complex disease in CF
   patients.

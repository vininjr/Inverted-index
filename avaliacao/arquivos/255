TI Absorption of two antibacterial drugs, cephalexin and
   co-trimoxazole, in malabsorption syndromes.

AB Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of cephalexin,
   trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) were measured in
   normal subjects and in patients with coeliac disease, small bowel
   diverticulosis, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis (cephalexin only)
   and after administration of cholestyramine.  The absorption of
   cephalexin was improved in coeliac disease diverticulosis and cystic
   fibrosis.  In Crohn's disease the peak plasma level was reduced and
   delayed.  The absorption of both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole
   was increased in all three conditions.  However there was a
   disproportionate increase in the plasma level of trimethoprim in
   coeliac disease and diverticulosis when compared with that of
   sulphamethoxazole.  In Crohn's disease there was a threefold
   increase in the peak plasma level of sulphamethoxazole.  After
   cholestyramine administration there was malabsorption of all three
   drugs.

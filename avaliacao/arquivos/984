AB The coexistence of cystic fibrosis (CF) and coeliac disease (CD) is
   reported in eight children, the odds against this occurring in the
   same child being 1:2 million to 1:5.9 million.  In Sweden, it would
   be around 1:3 million (incidence of CF 1:3000 and of CD 1:1000).
   The coexistence of these two diseases is thought to be chance,
   although CF might predispose to the development of CD.  In a 10-year
   period (with 33405 live births), we observed three children with
   exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and small intestine dysfunction.

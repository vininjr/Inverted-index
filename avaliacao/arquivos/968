AB Little has been published on cystic fibrosis (CF) in Whites in
   southern Africa, and no figures as to incidence exist. A register of
   CF patients, their parents (obligatory carriers), siblings, uncles,
   aunts and first cousins (potential carriers) has been compiled for
   southern Africa. The degree of co-operation shown by colleagues and
   by families whose addresses have been provided by them, and possible
   reasons for non-co-operation are discussed. From the numbers and
   birth dates of patients a rough estimate of the incidence in the
   Republic of South Africa, South West Africa and Rhodesia has been
   made. In all three regions, but especially in South Africa, incidence
   is likely to have been underestimated. Details available from the
   register include the number of CF patients alive and dead, those who
   presented with meconium ileus, the number of affected patients per
   family, consanguinity among the parents or grandparents, the
   frequency with which identical surnames were encountered, and the
   sibship sizes of all those on the register. Towns and districts with
   a population rich in the CF gene are mentioned. The number of
   potential carriers has been determined, so that they can be screened
   when a practicable detection test is devised. The register has
   answered a number of questions about CF in southern Africa. It has
   focused attention on the disease in the region and played a major
   catalytic role in the formation of the Southern African Cystic
   Fibrosis Association.

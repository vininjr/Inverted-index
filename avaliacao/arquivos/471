EX The composition of sweat and its relationship to the condition and
   site of collection are of interest in environmental physiology,
   dermatology, and the study of cystic fibrosis.  This study was
   undertaken to compare the concentrations of sodium and chloride in
   whole body sweat of normal control patients and of CF patients
   obtained by thermal stimulation with samples collected locally by
   pilocarpine iontophoresis.  Electrolyte concentrations in whole body
   sweat samples correlated in a highly significant fashion with sodium
   and chloride values found in arm patch sweat.  Patients with CF,
   however, showed significantly higher sodium and chloride
   concentrations in arm patch sweat and whole body sweat, and increased
   sodium excretion rates.

AB Tests for airways obstruction based on a forced expiration were
   carried out in 60 children with asthma and 15 with cystic fibrosis
   to determine which test or tests were the best in identifying
   children with airways disease, to determine the severity of disease
   and to document response to therapy.  Maximum expiratory flow,
   measured from a maximum expiratory flow volume curve, and maximum
   mid-expiratory flow measured from a spirogram, were the most
   sensitive tests in detecting early disease.  Maximum expiratory flow
   measured from the maximum expiratory flow volume curve, combined
   with measurement of lung volumes, gave the best overall estimate of
   severity.  Peak expiratory flow rate measured with a Peak Flow
   Meter, because of its simplicity of measurement, was the most useful
   test for routine use in the clinic and consulting room to monitor
   severity and response to therapy.
